is his first directorial venture,less by design and more by circumstances.Based on the brilliant script by Amol Gupte who is one of the innovative painters and theater personalities,the story dwells into the life of boy struggling to find himself in this ruthless world.Briefly,the boy &quot;Ishan&quot; who suffers from dyslexia comes from a middle class Indian family who is unable to read/learn or identify letters.Constantly bombarded with unrelenting taunts for his poor academics and being labeled as a &quot;duffer&quot;,he is isolated into his world of colors which is the only place he can seek solace in.But Ishan reaches a new low when he is packed off to boarding school by his father.The hard regimen and discipline of the school frustrates the boy out of his wits and he is finding drastic ways to put an end to his misery.He no longer feels th need to communicate .Just when things seem irrevocable,comes the art teacher,Aamir Khan,who being a dyslexic himself and working with the &quot;less privileged&quot; children identifies Ishan&apos;s troubles and can read through his silence,is sanitized by the apathy towards him.Then starts the process of resurrecting the boy&apos;s dying self belief and charting out a way for him to read and learn.The boy starts to slowly but surely come out of his shell and become a &quot;child&quot; again.\n\nOne of the many aspects of a perfect film is that nothing seems to stand out,every aspect whether it be the performances,the camera work,the sound mixing,the lighting,the editing etc everything seems in sync.Same can be said about this movie.But the thing that I found overwhelming as a viewer is the music by &quot;Shankar&quot;-Ehsaan-Loy&quot; and the lyrics by &quot;Prasoon Joshi&quot;.Watch out for &quot;taare zameen par&quot;,&quot;Meri Maa&quot;,these will definitely break you down.The cinematography by Setu is flawless and Aamir does not fall into the trap of being slick or showing off in his debut effort.(Watch how the camera is usually at Ishan&apos;s height to show his perspective,watch how slowly the camera pans into Ishan&apos;s space and how still and focused it is on his face when he is about to bare his emotions) \n\nThe performances are top draw.Darsheel who plays Ishan is the crux of the film.Being the main protagonist his performance was critical to the film.I dare say,we have found a new star.The boy is brilliant in his joy,in his enthusiasm,in his loneliness as he allows us to enter his world.I feel he represents children all over the world and more critically the &quot;child&quot; within all of us.Of the support cast Tisca Chopra and Aamir Khan are brilliant as his mother and teacher respectively.Because the movie revolves around a middle class family in suburban Mumbai,I guess these characters and their emotions are something I can relate to.\n\nFinally(on the movie),kudos to Amol Gupte and Aamir Khan.Let us not forget this was Amol&apos;s baby and he had worked with children and done research for 7 years.What he came with was a near perfect script and it is only fair that he was credited as a creative director.What can I say about Aamir Khan that hasn&apos;t been said before?I think with every movie he is setting new yardsticks for Indian cinema.His movies clearly have elaborated that our movies can have all the commercial trappings yet need not be &quot;dumbed down&quot;.They can be as intellectually stimulating.All I can say is that it is privilege to be in an era where this champion actor is at the absolute peak of his powers.With this movie he goes into the elite list of actors who happen to be great story tellers.\n\nBut is this movie about dyslexia?Is this movie about the failure of our education system in not nurturing the individual talent but creating assembly line products?Are we as a society so obsessed with the &quot;idea&quot; of security through academics that creativity is of no accord to us?Are we preparing our children for a rat race or we preparing them for life?Are parents right in imposing their ambitions on the life they bring to this earth ?Some question that I have asked of myself before and some that I ask now.I guess the main motive of the film is as the tag line says &quot;every child is special&quot; for the talent he has.Our job is to nurture it,not mold it.\n\np.s. I have been a frequent movie goer for last 7-8 years.But haven&apos;t seen a response like I did for this one.Everyone in the theater was in tears and simultaneous applause and is not because it was a sad film but it was &quot;overwhelming&quot;.I guess there some part of Ishan in all of our lives.The second aspect that I have never witnessed in theaters before was that nobody moved till the credits were over.There is documentary on children at the end(do not miss it for anything,it is as moving as the film).""},""aggregateRating""","[""Drama"",""Family""]","""2007-12-21""","""teacher student relationship,dyslexia,against the odds,paint,water""","""2H45M""",15.0

It couldn&apos;t deliver to its full potential, but at any moment in the story I didn&apos;t feel bored.

If you&apos;re going to this movie thinking Aamir will be flexing and showcasing his acting prowess then well and good but the girls are the highlight of the movie, hands down. SCRIPT - Major props to bringing out a story which is inspiring and one which India needs right now. The story is kept grounded in reality. No over-the-top gimmicks. The songs blend in very well with the premise. None of the scenes linger on for a long period of time. There was a very natural flow to the story which helped engage the audience for 2 hours and 41 minutes. Even movies like Mary Kom or Bhaag Milkha Bhaag started to drag by the end but hats off to Piyush Gupta and Shreyas Jain. I have said this that dialogue shouldn&apos;t seem like dialogue unless it is a musical or a re-imagining of a play. The dialogue in this movie is a lesson as to how dialogue should be used. Little nods and grunts and expressions serve more than an explanatory conversation. I am not a fan of narration and I wasn&apos;t really liking it here either. It was fine for the light-hearted scenes but the serious scenes required silence but I can give it a pass. The only scene which felt a bit off is where Mahavir gets locked up in a room before the final fight. If it didn&apos;t happen in reality then it was really unnecessary. DIRECTION - Chillar Party was a movie with some serious message but was a little preachy and Bhootnath Returns went full preachy. Nitesh Tiwari toned down that preaching to a very natural level in this movie. Every single topic that has happened or still happens in a family was touched upon. Beginning from the sleaziness of men to child-marriage to the sacrifice parents make, everything was utilised to the advantage of the movie. None of that brought the movie to a halt. The first half of the movie had a good amount of comedy and that gelled into the second half with ease. The thing that many might not notice that there are no pay-off scenes except for the last scene. If the audience reaches a peak before the ending then the pay-off wouldn&apos;t have a solid effect, if used multiple times. Pay-off scenes are those scenes where the characters are shown to be doing things in extra slow-motion to have an orgasmic effect on the audience and the director cleverly used it at the end in order to give proper tribute to the art and the character. FIGHT CHOREOGRAPHY - This section needed a category of it&apos;s own and quite deservedly. I saw Mary Kom, Sultan and Saala Khadoos which had extensive fight scenes and all of the movies had extremely lack-lustre fight scenes. The camera moved too much in order to cover up the actor/actresses&apos; incapability to fight. In comparison to all those movies, here the camera just followed the fighters. No wide-shots of the fight from the audience&apos;s perspective because that allows the stunt double to come in. All the fights had the actresses in the scene and hats off to all of them for their dedication. ACTING - Like I said before, the best performance among some amazing performances was of the newcomer Fatima Sana Shaikh. That said, it will really be unjust to name one performance as the best performance because everyone was amazing in this movie. Aamir Khan, Sakshi Tanwar, Sanya Malhotra, Aparshakti Khurana,Zaira Wasim, Suhani Bhatnagar,Ritwik Shore and Girish Kulkarni gave amazing performances. As Aamir had put on so much weight, that altered his physicality a lot which enhanced his performance to another level. Sakshi Tanwar should be doing more movies. She gave a very subdued and nuanced performance. Sanya Malhotra as the grown up Babita had very few scenes but her eyes spoke when she didn&apos;t have any dialogue. Zaira Wasim and Sulhani Bhatnagar were awesome, just awesome. I was in awe how they are able to emote so much at their age. Ritwik Shore and Aparshakti Khurana together made Omkar a memorable character. I think they had some of the best scenes in the entire movie. I wanted to kill Girish Kulkarni after Ugly and after this I still want to kill him and that&apos;s a compliment. The side actors who formed the audience and little roles like the Dangal organiser and the guy who had sleazy theatre also gave substance to the movie. FINAL VERDICT - I am sure everyone has seen this movie by now and if you haven&apos;t then please do. It&apos;s a complete movie and it is very rare to see a complete movie, without gimmicks nowadays. I loved how they had such eye for detail because they gave that damaged effect to Aamir&apos;s ear. Many wouldn&apos;t notice it but it&apos;s great to that they did to provide authenticity to the character and the movie. It&apos;s a 10/10 for me and one of the best movies of 2016."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Biography"",""Drama""]","""2016-12-23""","""small town,father daughter relationship,male objectification,bare chested male,female protagonist""","""2H41M""",6.0

Oops.that&apos;s suppose to be Rang De Basanti.. Well that&apos;s exactly the director tries to convey. Its about today, us and our present, yet the similarities we have from the Pre-independence era. The Gen-x who knows Mac-D but still prefers the Dhaba Paranthas with sweet Lassi. However they restrict their national values only to food and nothing more. Its not a run of the mill stuff with 6 six romantic songs, couple of foreign locales and then finally some emotional drama.. No no no.. Rang Deis a Cult movie. It is more of an introspection, a food for our thought process. It makes us think, as to how should we actually celebrate our freedom. I was really moved by some of the ending lines by the narrator, &quot;I thought there are 2 types of people in the world, one who die crying and other who move away in silence but today I learned there is third genre, people who go laughing&quot;. That says it all \n\nRang De is definitely a very brave and innovative attempt by the director and for that matter he has selected a near perfect cast. However veterans like Om Puri and Anupam Kher looked disposed. All the characters grow gradually in the film and make you think their way. Everyone is given enough space to justify their talent. Rakesh Omprakash Mehra is a director of the new emerging Indian cinema, he always tries to bring in something very different. I was really impressed by his last attempt in 2001 for Aks (Amitabh Bachchan and Manoj Bajpai ), and he definitely has succeeded in making another fabulous master piece. The highlight of the movie is the great use of cinematography techniques. Its probably for the first time in Indian cinema that juxtaposing has been used with such a great effect. The way each character gradually immerses into scenes from the past leaves you fantasizing about the hard work that has gone in the background to create this, both technically and on the part of the actor.\n\nThe movie starts on a very high spirit reflecting today&apos;s youth mindset who believe that patriotism is something that looks good in history chapters and today&apos;s world is far ahead of all that, they would prefer to go boozing and dancing rather than thinking on any of those lines. The way the campus scenes are shown really makes everyone go down the memory lanes of beautiful college days. This is followed by some intriguing drama and events which turns the life of a group of buddies upside-down altogether.\n\nThe film grows on you gradually. The director has made sure that there is a clear message in everything he presents, even the group of boys represents different sects of society and religion. Hence creating an appeal for everyone watching it. Music is another high point of the show, its foot tapping and very much with the mood of the subject. The songs give you a sense of freedom from within, a freedom to think in one&apos;s own way. A.R. Rehman doesn&apos;t need any introductions and he is surely one of the most original music directors we have in the country.\n\nThe brilliance of Aamir Khan is something very difficult to narrate, he has proved it umpteen number of times that he is truly the most versatile actor in the industry. His comic timing in the first part is better than anything seen in recent past. He is extremely fluent even with difficult Punjabi tongue twisters and the acting prowess he has shown would be very difficult to match by anyone around. He appears so natural and his complete look with new hairstyle (which is now part of his every new movie) gives a very striking combination.\n\nWell the most wanting part of the whole thing has been the script to certain extent, it appears very loose in the second half and at times gives a droning feel. Few new ideas presented by the author looked half-baked. However it has been the technical expertise of the director who managed to save the things with some outstanding camera work and editing.\n\nRang De  is for sure a must watch movie, it doesn&apos;t have any preaching but still it will force you to think once. As they say it &quot;There are two primary choices in life, to accept conditions as they exist or take upon the responsibility to change them&quot;. I believe most of us want to bring about the changes without doing anything, so its time to think again folks and take some responsibility, lets Paint It Yellow"",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Crime"",""Drama""]","""2006-01-26""","""delhi india,murder,friend,india,awakening""","""2H47M""",16.0

It is an exceptional sports film, more because there&apos;s much more to it than just a series of games, and you never care about the fact that the ending is easy to predict. Shimit Amin, who previously directed Ab Tak Chapphan, directs the film with great skill, care, and feeling for the subject. Jaideep Sahni is responsible for the fantastic script, and that&apos;s where we get an original example of expert storytelling.\n\nThis is the story of Kabir Khan, once a hockey star and a captain of the Indian team. Seven years ago, he was accused of treason in favour of Pakistan because he missed a crucial penalty against them. Being a Muslim and being good sport about it did the job and, branded a traitor, Kabir left his ancestral home in shame. We know nothing about what he&apos;s been through in these seven years, but we do know that he&apos;s got a new chance to prove his innocence when he comes back as the coach of the Indian woman&apos;s field hockey team. A chance as crucial as this damned penalty stroke.\n\nThe second half is much stronger than the first (not that this one&apos;s bad), but that&apos;s the case with most sports films as the most enjoyable sequences are often in later portions, when the matches finally take place. And well, it is just full of suspense, tension, and even though I could easily predict the ending, the script and direction were good enough to keep me on the edge of my seat and give me quite a few goosebumps throughout it. In fact several moments throughout the matches were so exhilarating and overwhelming that I found myself jumping up off my seat with sheer joy.\n\nTechnically the film is superb. The cinematography is amazing, with the camera moving intelligently to focus the viewer&apos;s attention on the proceedings. The film is efficiently edited, and the background score more than contributes to the film, building tension where necessary, and making everything so much more captivating. The title track, &quot;Chak De India&quot; is really a treat. It is patriotic, joyful, and very well used in the film. That the film&apos;s songs atypically play only over montage sequences, as opposed to the traditional style of song and dance, is certainly a great plus.\n\nShahrukh Khan is tremendous. This is one of his most restrained performances, yet his charismatic presence is as evident as ever. He is perfectly natural and controlled in a most nuanced portrayal that never fails to convey the inner pain, the frustration, the hope and the quiet determination to clear his name and finally make a place in the sun. The supporting cast is roundly good, and the girls are great as a group. Shilpa Shukla enjoys the meatiest part, an assertive girl driven by ego and jealousy, and she is excellent. Sagarika Ghatge and Vidya Malvade are pretty and convincing.\n\nChak De India can be described as patriotic, feminist, but for me it&apos;s more than anything about willpower and the importance of hard and collaborative work. It teaches and reaffirms that what really makes such games work--and for that matter, many other things in life--is lots of training, patience, and team work, without which nothing would quite click. According to me the best Hindi film of 2007; a thrilling and inspiring cinematic experience which is worth many a repeat viewing for more than one reason. Take a bow, Mr. Amin, Mr. Sahni, Mr. Khan, and all of you, twelve brave cuties."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama"",""Family"",""Sport""]","""2007-08-10""","""team,hockey,coach,brawl,boyfriend girlfriend relationship""","""2H33M""",15.0

The result is a near 3hr film that just flies by. Comedy, Drama, Great Songs, love stories that work, and some truly excellent casting. Everyone carries the film, and the 3 guys, Safi, Akshay and Aamir are too good together!\n\nHopefully this film is a wake up call to the rest of Bollywood, who seem to be obsessed with unoriginality. Technically DCH can easily stand up against anything from the West.

This extremism mainly comes from my distrust on Indian Media which trashes movies that are comfortably awesome. Okay. If you are planning to go for it, do not read the rest of this. Come back and do it. This movie deserves an open mind. It shouldn&apos;t be that you go inside the theater with some invisible strings controlling how you perceive it. Let me tell you it is simple. It is also beautiful. And the combination makes it immense.\n\nRight from the first scene, the director makes this his own. I wonder how many directors in this industry will be able to give a complete character definition of the protagonists through a sequence depicting their luggage-packing-styles for a 3 week trip. Zoya Akhtar does exactly that. She is a genius. I&apos;ll come back to her.\n\nLets look at the actors. Abhay Deol, Farhan Akhtar, Kalki Koechlin, Katrina Kaif and Hrithik Roshan. Abhay Deol is a stalwart. He has been a part of movies that have changed the face of Indian Cinema. Hrithik Roshan is another great actor. His movies have always contained a central theme of self-improvement. And for me, he is mind-blowing. Farhan Akhtar is a multi talented dude. Acting, singing, directing with equal panache. Any competitors? No. Kalki Koechlin has proved her worth in Shaitan and Dev D.\n\nThe real surprise in this movie comes from Katrina Kaif. She is amazing in this movie as the NRI diving instructor with high intellect. She embodies the role with such ease that she never looks the out-of-place girl she usually does. And she is hot in a very warm way. Her physicality is projected and used by Zoya in a controlled manner which enhances her beauty.\n\nHrithik is at his best, giving 100% to the role and carrying the transformations in his character so smoothly that at the end you feel happy for him. His journey across his life comes alive on screen through his facial expression. And eyes. The use of sunglasses by Zoya is absolutely perfect.\n\nAbhay is the usual casual fellow you could find strewn all over India. But such is his expertise, he makes that guy stand out. Where Farhan and Hrithik have characters with a certain premise, Abhay&apos;s Kabir(a) is a free-bird. And boy, how he uses the freedom! A treat to watch, his dialogue throwing style adds a very important spice to the movie. It pierces you.\n\nKalki is good. With a limited screen-time, she fares really well. She has one shriek in the whole movie and one funny sequence while singing &quot;I&apos;m a hot chick in a hard rock world&quot;. These two scenes show us why she is different. Pretty powerful stuff. The perfect sugar coated knife.\n\nFarhan. Hats off. You just blew my expectation ceiling with an atomic bomb. Perfect, infallible comic timing. Add to that the raspy, metal-on-wood voice, the casual sense of style, the few looks of soul-searching and the full blown expression of joy after Sky Diving. What you get is in my opinion the best performance I have seen in some time. Character constructed, deconstructed, resurrected with the absolute smoothness of a tequila shot.\n\nCinematography. The whole movie is pivoted on the use of short range focus. Pure genius. It makes the scenes look alive. Almost as if you are looking at the characters in reality.\n\nLocales. Its one thing to choose correctly and absolutely another to use it. ZNMD sells Spain like Rafael Nadal and Barcelona. The azure blue ocean, the gray and dark plateaus, the vibrant green forests, the super sexy roads and a flaming yellow sunset. Breathtaking.\n\nSongs. What lyrics. Perfectly picturised. Totally blends into the script.\n\nBackground score. I can&apos;t stop if I start on this. The use of the heartbeat promotes the signature sound from the murky depths of Kal Ho Na Ho to the actual surge of nervous energy it stands for. The use of the silencing technique while slowing up the screen pace creates magic moments. And whoever played the rapturous guitar chords did a great job. Awesome.\n\nDialogues. Great. General stuff mostly but again, the relevance and timing kills it.\n\nAll these factors combined with the finesse of Zoya creates the unforgettable experience of ZNMD. The movie is about a lot of things. About relationships, about self discovery, about losing control, about life in a microscopic view. But above all, it glorifies friendship, a virtue that is priceless. It will take you through a plethora of emotions, evoked by the various situations faced by Imran, Kabir and Arjun. The situations poised are some real problems the current society is facing like career v/s life, identity crisis, family pressure and relationship maintenance. And truly, they fit the characters.\n\nThe single thing that separates this movie from other hits is the creation of numerous magic moments. Directorial expertise blends with the awesome crew work to make you jump in mirth, look with awe, feel good from within, suppress a tiny tear drop, dance in your mind and applaud a timely joke. I would recommend this movie to everyone, just like Iqbal. It will give you wings. And it will give you the desire to take flight, to live your life like never before.\n\nFinally, the idea of using shayaris to verbally emote key junctions of the movie is brilliant. In Farhan&apos;s voice, it adds to the overall positive vibration of the movie and moves you. Excellent. Thank you Bollywood, for making this movie."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Drama"",""Musical""]","""2011-07-15""","""spain,underwater scene,bollywood musical,bare chested male,vacation""","""2H35M""",11.0

I think their script writer was plastered while writing the script. If their information happens to be correct,what were our freedom fighters doing then? India joined the war on 3rd of December 1971. And the war started on 25th of March the same year. India didn&apos;t give birth to Bangladesh,rather the bloodshed of our 3 million martyrs did. Director can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us.\n\n2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. they showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land in their film.

Move over commercial masala potboilers with item songs, hero smashing 10 guys with a single blow and typical song-dance routine – Raja Menon&apos;s Airlift will give you goosebumps with fast-paced gritting thrills and excitement.\n\nBased on a true story, Airlift speaks about the Ranjit Katyal (played by Akshay Kumar) who helps the Indian Government collaborate with Air India to help evacuate 1,70,000 Indians from Kuwait after Iraq raided the country.\n\nFrom the director of critical acclaimed films like Bas Yun Hi and Barah Aana, Raja Menon does a fantastic research about the feat that was even recorded in the Guinness Book of World Record and surprisingly people are unaware about it. Airlift will consume you right from the beginning especially when Akshay&apos;s family faces the issue of Iraqi raiding Kuwait. From here onward, there is no turning back as the movie gives you nice twist-n-turns with well- choreographed action scenes. Icing on the cake is the climax scenes which has been well executed. On the flip side, length of the movie could have been reduced little further. But brilliant screenplay, Art direction and cinematography is spellbinding. Background score gels well with the mood of the film. Dialogues are fine. The music of the film is doing well on the chartbuster. The soulful number such as &apos;Soch Na Sake&apos; is already a superhit among the viewers. Besides, other tracks are catching up fast as well.\n\nIt is Akshay Kumar&apos;s show all the way. A thumbs up to him for doing something different from his usual masala potboilers.

The fresh pairing of Akshay Kumar and Nimrat Kaur works well.

The movie has got no great story as the title tells you the one line &quot;Express love on a journey&quot;. It&apos;s a usual SRK movie with Rohit Shetty style of execution. \n\nSince the plot surrounds strong Tamil background I have to tell you my analysis in two views 1. As a viewer like me from Tamil Nadu 2. As a Non tamilian viewer As a viewer like me from Tamil Nadu it was like a spoof of 1980&apos;s Tamil movie and sometimes looked like humiliating Tamilians. For a non Tamil viewer like my friends they did like the Tamil base in it. Since we can see so much of Tamil influence in Bollywood industry nowadays. To start off with singers from Tamil, actors from Tamil like Dhanush directors from Tamil AR Murugadoss and choreographers from Tamil Prabhudeva. But it does promise you to stay glued to your seats by all the necessary ingredients. \n\nSRK as usual a non serious Indian blushing types of hero and was yet again with his trade name Rahul. He does a great job and gives what was demanded for a film like this. At least this time he has come with a character with an age of 40. \n\nWorth mention would be the lady lead Deepika Padukone she has done an excellent job by adapting the Tamil style of English and Hindi speaking. She was shown well in the movie with her beautiful makeover.\n\nSatyaraj plays the father fits the role picture perfect. The villain has done justice to the role of Thangaballi. There are so many gigantic long haired fatty black goons you will see in the movie. Direction,Camera, Music and Editing were good as per requirements for a spicy masala. \n\nMusic was very good particularly &quot;Titli&quot; was a good breezy romantic number that makes us hum after we come out of the theater.\n\nI have to say the positives were Deepika,SRK and music. Negatives were the sets and Tamil base were over colored and totally artificial. \n\nGet in for a movie which has got something for everyone in the family to keep you entertained for 2 hours 20 mins. \n\n-Reviewed by Sivakumar Balachandran\n\n(bsiva84@gmail.com)"",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Adventure"",""Comedy""]","""2013-08-09""","""temple,train ride,cricket the sport,cell phone,cross country trip""","""2H21M""",9.0

They are so good in fact, that you tend to forget how long and dragged out the film is! As soon as you get to a new song, it is like a complete battery recharge. There are some real moments of laughter, tears, and drama which is more than you get in most movies. Also, to set the record straight- ALL HINDI FILMS ARE PADDED OUT TO APPROX. 3 HOURS. Live with it! It means there will be stupid comedy, boring scenes, etc. You make your way through those (with the remote if you are REALLY impatient), to get to the gold (wonderful costumes, music, scenery, etc). If properly edited and released in the U.S., this could be an arthouse hit. The musical numbers rank right up there with GREASE.

At the same time we can see an excellent equation and emotional turmoil building up between Saajan /Irrfann, the serious and lonely parting boss and Shaikh/Nawazuddin, his future replacement, who is funny and enthusiastic and quiet opposite to his boss.In some cases Nawazuddin has overshadowed Irfann too!

What else one can need ?? My first impressions were, &apos;WOW, this Shahrukh guy has a tremendous screen presence (but, yikes, what a profile!)&apos; and &apos;I love the old guy with the black hair&apos; but still the potential of the character is very real with a touch of grass root and it&apos;s totally judged by king Khan. This is ShahRukh&apos;s best performance after &quot;SWADES&quot;. &quot;Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi&quot; is a common man real life drama made into a modish glamorous movie. The film has a knowable love story made to look like an extraordinary film by Aditya Chopra as it comes with intense emotions, songs, dances, drama and succeeds in touching hearts of audiences. You enjoy, cry and have fun watching the film. Performance of Shahrukh is at its best and Anushka is made to match him.\n\nAditya Chopra writes and directs ably proving that his first movie &quot;DDLJ&quot; was no fluke . In fact &quot;MOHABBATEIN&quot; carries the same theme of love way ahead of &quot;DDLJ&quot; but in case of &quot;RNBDJ&quot; it&apos;s really disappointing. The dialogues are average but yes Shahrukh is surely over the top... but isn&apos;t that the reason why he is where he is today. no character has to justify their actions but for the fact that they are driven by their emotions... which is pretty common among common human beings..\n\nThe problem I have is with what exactly message the movie wants to spread? I feel that the movie is trying to say, love first other things later. Other things including personal relationships, office work and careers.\n\nBut to be honest, I didn&apos;t like this movie much, and after seeing about 100 Hindi films since then, I still don&apos;t like it much. It has some great songs that are almost completely destroyed by the ancient and I still can&apos;t sit through the endless love stories of the couple.\n\nYou don&apos;t have action thrills suspense but those going for Shahrukh Khan&apos;s film, can watch the movie. Since the film is coming with high expectations many won&apos;t find it up to their thoughts. \n\nOverall, the story and the execution is a let down. The performances are decent and the movie sure has some light moments that would make you smile and laugh. The film fits all generations, families and ages and it can be expected to be a hit film. At the all important box-office, the opening has been surprisingly not upto expectations for such a huge film. It should pick up over the weekend. Going past the Week 1 figures of either Singh Is King or Om Shanti Om seems highly unlikely."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Drama"",""Music""]","""2008-12-12""","""marriage,disguise,dancing,local blockbuster,assumed identity""","""2H47M""",14.0

It was totally worth the wait, the hype and the 750 KM travel all the way back and forth from Chennai to Bangalore and vice cersa in bike in a single day. A magnum Opus by Kamal. A technically brilliant piece of cinema this. This movie is a world class commercial thriller which tickles ur intellect a little bit and if you&apos;re up there going with the flow of the movie, you will love it if you&apos;re a cinema lover and not a Kamal fan.

Can easily enjoy more the second time.\n\nThe scenes that were talked about with gargantuan hype, the transformation scene and the pre interval block, truly are worth the hype and MORE! Whattaayy!! Simply stunning. I am tempted to say more but will stop, watch it for yourself. \n\nThe first half goes at a breakneck pace and it is over before you realise its over. The Afghanisthan block of the film, about the Al-Qaeda terrorists are carefully and intensely shot. Absolutely brilliant making!!! And I forgot the fact that i was watching a tamil movie in the second half. The cinematography, BGMs were of international standards. Kamal, the director, scores over Kamal the actor, which he always does when he directs, whether it is Heyram, Virumaandi or Vishwaroopam. Easily his second best work as director next to Heyram. The movie ends with a promise to have a sequel coming up and you only will wait for it to come as soon as possible to know the answers for many questions in the first movie. \n\nAnd does it hurt any religious sentiment? Absolutely not! In fact, while watching the movie, I didn&apos;t even realise there was an issue going on. Don&apos;t know what all the fuss was about. We, the Tamil audience, are being deprived of our right in seeing a movie and in seeing the legendary Kamal Haasan.

Pluses- Story, Acting, Cinematography, Second half, The scenes which feature Srk and Alia. The family moments of Kiara and her family, her Friends. The execution of the entire movie from event to event. The whole final act which leaves you in a happy mood. The breakdown sequence. The maturity in the direction which takes the movie into a new level. The Dialogues given to SRK. Negatives- The music is good but isn&apos;t great. The Editing in the first half could have been better. If you have enjoyed movies like Wake Up Sid, Kapoor and Sons Rockstar, Queen, English Vinglish . Go for this one. One of the best movies of the year.

I found out that Indian movie is worth to watch, the idea of the story is original, based on India everyday life, problem, dilemma. I know Vinglish was something when I read about the plot. This is not about romance between two countries, love which separated by time and distance, unapproved love. This about a good housewife who was very loyal and serve her family entirely. Her name is Shashi. She had side job as a laddu maker (Indian traditional cake). But one thing which become a family joke all the time was her inability to speak English. A very obvious moment how embarrassed her daughter, Sapna, with her was when she should replaced her husband in school meeting (reports day). This the new information to me, in some schools in India, the daily language is English. Sashi unable talk in English and asked the teacher talked in Hindi, Sapna glared at her and refused talk to her on their way returned home. Not only Sapna, her husband, Sathish somehow disregarded her ability as a laddu maker only. \n\nSashi asked by his sister to help her prepared her wedding&apos;s daughter in US, Sashi willing to help, but the consequence was she must leave by herself. The others family member would joined her later. Sashi was afraid because she unable speak English and this is the first time she left her home all by herself. But eventually she left. With full of happiness meeting her sister and nephew, Radha, she&apos;s still bothered about the embarrassment of her daughter and what her husband said. \n\nOne day she saw an ad about learning English fluently on 6 weeks! Sashi showed her interest and memorized the number. She sign up herself for the program secretly. In this course she meet a cute French guy, Laurent, who helped her in the other day. He fancy her which was just too visible! Sashi enjoyed the class very much and followed the lesson well. She gained confidence and decided to follow the class till the end of the program. But Radha found out Sashi walked with Laurent, and asked who was he. Sashi revealed she took an English course and Radha supported her. Will Sashi finish her English course? Which one Sathi choose, Sathis or Laurent? You should find it by yourself by watching this humor-drama movie! \n\nMany scenes become my favorites, conversation between Amitabachan and American Immigration officer is one of. Gauri Shinde as a director, was very rigorous present it in a smart way, which is mostly I found in Hollywood movie. As an Indian movie, i gave you all my thumbs!

It&apos;s silly, it&apos;s ridiculous, it&apos;s mad, it lacks a real storyline, but it&apos;s so much fun. The movie has great action sequences, fantastic music, an all-star cast, but more than anything it has Salman Khan, who totally delivers in a role that is a caricature of his own image. That&apos;s Chulbul Pandey hands down. He&apos;s carefree, he&apos;s corrupt, he&apos;s cruel, he&apos;s tough, he&apos;s cool, he&apos;s got a good heart, and he&apos;s dabangg (fearless). He practically encompasses everything that Salman Khan is known for, and the actor wonderfully displays this fun mixture on-screen to create a role he will definitely be remembered for. In many portions, Dabangg works because it&apos;s unintentionally hilarious, and the funniest thing about it lies in the fact that it was actually the intention, and that&apos;s what makes it so terribly entertaining. And then it has several moments of drama, and they somehow manage to work. In a few words, Dabangg is one of the rarest of it kind, and is one of the best bad movies of recent years. I recommend you to watch it once, and then watch it again, and again, and again..."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Comedy"",""Crime""]","""2010-09-10""","""action hero,police officer,laundry drying on a clothesline,hose,corrupt police officer""","""2H6M""",12.0

The few other key characters in the script get quickly introduced in the next 20 minutes with fast intercuts between its short scenes and the progression never really gives you some time even to look at your mobile phone (following the routine habit). In the middle PIKU turns into a road movie with the team of four (Amitabh, Deepika, Irrfan and the servant) deciding to go to Kolkatta via road (car) from Delhi and then the city of joy greets you well with another impressive Bengali couple strongly demanding your attention with their noticeable act. Its final moments make you feel the pain of separation with moist eyes and the climax leaves you thinking on an indecisive note, probably shying away from having a routine, predictable end.\n\nBased on a unique and unusual plot about constipation, PIKU is certainly not an easy film to make as it doesn&apos;t have any descriptive storyline and it more or less remains predictable too once its basic premise gets revealed in the initial moments. The topic of toiler humour is quite difficult to express in dialogues being spoken on dinner tables but Juhi does it superbly establishing the loving relationship between the old age father and his daughter in the early thirties. The sequences keep delivering many enjoyable moments and good laughs regularly till the finale and one doesn&apos;t feel tired at all watching only 4-5 characters in the entire film simply conversing with each other on the topic of constipation. In other words, the film has no conflict as such (as it was there in VICKY DONOR) but Sircar still successfully manages to make it all fun and nothing boring or dragging with an amazing ease reminding you of the classic films from Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Basu Chatterjee.\n\nAn intelligent film made straight from the heart, PIKU fearlessly talks about many serious issues in a comical mode such as old age ailment, the lonely life of a widower or a widow when their grown up kids are willing to start their own family, the attention seeking nature of old people and the nostalgia they like to keep living in remembering the gone era. It focuses on a weird, over-indulgent father who feels no shame in telling a stranger that his young daughter is not a virgin and a visibly frustrated but caring daughter who only has the topic of constipation to talk about on the phone even when she is sitting in a restaurant on a dinner date. \n\nBesides the best part of the film turns out to be its particular scenes and dialogues dealing with Bengali language, culture and the city of Kolkatta, making it a visual treat to enjoy along with the touching relationships developing between its various characters. Musically, PIKU has few average but soothing numbers from singer- songwriter-composer Anupam Roy (his debut Hindi project) perfectly suiting the mood of the film. Plus the beautiful cinematography, crisp editing (though too quick at times) and casual costumes designed quite authentically establish an instant connection with the viewer enhancing its overall impact.\n\nMoving into performances, though the film has two towering male personalities having their own distinctive screen presence known to all, the film still completely belongs to Deepika Padukone alone as conveyed by the title PIKU that happens to be her nickname (the original name not mentioned anywhere). The actress truly gives another career best performance as the young, casual, middle class, working girl (with minimal make-up) who has twinkling eyes, killer looks and an adorable controlled grin that slowly makes you fall in love as the film proceeds further. \n\nAmitabh Bachchan as Banerjee is a sheer delight to watch and that too minus his baritone voice in an eccentric kind of character conversing in an enjoyable Bengali tone. He is simply outstanding slipping into a different body of an old man annoyed of his own non- existing or self-assumed diseases. And I really doubt we have any other actor around who could be giving these kinds of performances at the age of 70. Completing the trio, Irrfan Khan as expected plays the travel agency owner with an incredible perfection. The way he calls out his drivers to take up different duties and his entertaining interactions with Amitabh Bachchan on the road trip generate a good laugh in the theatres. \n\nIn the supporting cast, that always has been the highlight of a Shoojit Sircar film we have the return of Moushumi Chatterjee on screen as the talkative Mausi who is delightful talking with Amitabh Bachchan about his dead wife, her sister. Raghuvir Yadav makes a decent impact as the friendly doctor and then the actors playing the Bengali couple, Irrfan&apos;s family and the accompanying servant, all remain fairly entertaining in their respective roles, particularly the servant.\n\nHaving praised the film whole heartedly, I still found PIKU as a project majorly made only to entertain its audiences (and not enlighten them), focusing less on the drama and emotional aspect of the relationships that happened to be the key element of films of Hrishi Da and Basu Da. Music being the soul of our Hindi films, the melody was once again missing though the lyrics were right there expressing it fine. Moreover it simply touches many sensitive issues of life but avoids getting into them in details fearing the viewer&apos;s loss of interest. \n\nHaving said that, with PIKU as one of the best films of 2015, Hindi film-makers do expand their vision of mainstream cinema exploring new ideas undoubtedly and therefore the film deserves to be seen as a must supporting the progressive move."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Drama""]","""2015-05-08""","""irritable bowel syndrome,father daughter relationship,character name in title,eccentric man,old man""","""2H3M""",7.0

This time he takes the form of Siddarth Mehra.\n\nFirstly though, Ayan Mukherji (story, screenplay and direction) deserves immense praise for his directorial debut venture. As far as the story goes, there is nothing new or novel. The script has no unexpected twists or such. It goes along at its own sweet pace and you can foretell every next incident. This is a movie more on the lines of &apos;Dil Chahta Hai&apos; meets &apos;Lakshya&apos;. But where Ayan scores heavily is in the direction and screenplay departments. The direction is fresh and uncomplicated. He stuck to the very basic rule and kept it simple, and this has definitely paid huge dividends. The screenplay is crisp and well executed. It shows in the way Ayan has resisted the desire to jump into song-and-dance sequences, as are most bollywood movies prone to, and thats a refreshing change.\n\nThe movie revolves around our protagonist Siddarth Mehra (Sid, as his friends call him), who is arrogant, self-centred, has an absolute disrespectful attitude to financial dealings (read shopping) and anything to do with exercising his mental capabilities. Be it learning at college or going through the daily 9-to-5 grind. Though most of us may not readily identify ourself with Sid, we all have surely known a personality like him at some point of our life. Sid strikes up friendship with Aisha Bannerjee, played superbly by Konkona Sen Sharma, during a boring farewell party. The friendship grows stronger, initially through e-mails and then through setting up Aisha&apos;s flat. The two characters are poles apart, Aisha strives to be independent, is organised and has a set of goals, whereas Sid on the other hand is carefree and childishly immature with not a care in the world. As the story evolves Sid has a spat with his parents and leaves home. He takes refuge in Aisha&apos;s flat and is slowly forced to delve deeper into his way of living. He has virtually taken everything for granted in his life so far, including his friends and his parents. He now has to take life by the horns. It can be safely said that he admires Aisha&apos;s opinion of him and transforms himself to please her in ways he never knew before, and in the process he matures in his thinking and takes responsibilities seriously. How he nurtures his hobby and utilises it to make a living, thus turning a new leaf in his life forms the rest of the story. Not to mention, he even realises he is in love too, as one is wont to expect.\n\nThe actors have all lived up to the expectations. Ranbir Kapoor as Sid is a revelation. This is the first movie i watched of his and i think he has a very bright future, though i would hate to see him go wandering into stereotype bollywood. The way he gets all childish when he has learnt to fry eggs is as admirable as it is funny. He is pleased as a punch and puts a smile on your face. Konkona Sen Sharma as Aisha does here what she knows doing best. She has acted in various roles doing justice to them all and the role of Aisha is no different. You just cant help but admire the various emotions that she can pull-off. A pleasing change from all the eye-candy mainstream actresses who have flooded bollywood of late. Supriya Pathak and Anupam Kher as Sid&apos;s parents do an applaudable job. The scene where Supriya Pathak tries to learn English so that she can bond with Sid more as a friend than a mother deserves a special mention. She sure strikes a few emotional chords with the mature audience. Kashmira Shah has very few lines in the movie and she is pleasing on the eye. Hope she had a meatier role. Rahul Khanna as the editor does his job well.\n\nThe direction is top-notch, so is the screenplay and acting. Some viewers may find it a bit too long but i think the editing is sharp and the camera work goes a long way to make this movie an interesting watch. Music by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy is pleasing on the ear without being too imposing. All-in-all its a good movie for a weekend at the cinemas as long as you don&apos;t look too deep into the &apos;same-old-story&apos; aspect.""},""aggregateRating""","[""Comedy"",""Drama"",""Romance""]","""2009-10-02""","""friend,writer,magazine,spoiled brat,realization""","""2H18M""",13.0

After all, it was a perfect entertainer &quot;paisa wasool&quot; movie. The length come out as as positive part. In India the more length is the movie the more &quot;paisa wasool&quot; it is. Especially movie like this, which is full of romance, drama, music and female body shows.\n\nI love the music of the movie. It was great. Also the acting by the legends Amitabh and SRK. And as usual of Yashraj films, the filmography and camera work was great too.\n\nThe problem I have is with what exactly message the movie wants to spread? I feel that the movie is trying to say, love first other things later. Other things including discipline, your studies and your career. The &quot;Gurukool&quot; is an ideal school for the college students. The principle expects from them that they should only concentrate on their studies, their career, personal development and their future, at least for the time which they will be spending in this college. (Thats another problem. What kind of school is it? Is it after 10th or after 12th school? And if it is after 12th, why are they wearing uniform?) And to accomplish this he has some strict set of rules. (They are too strict, Agreed.) Now from nowhere a new music teacher comes to college (when the principle does not allow any cultural program in college, why at first place he appointed this music teacher?). Now the music teacher is a real romantic guy, who has done romance with the daughter of the principle, when he himself was in the same college. As this is against the rules of college, principal throws the boy out, and his lover suicides, as her father rejected her love. (This is far too stretched. What? No, it isn&apos;t. OK. Not far stretched, and can happen in reality.) And this teacher has now swore that he will fill the entire college with the love. Means he will teach the student the cheap acts of how to write love letter in more effective ways (like using &apos;Piple ka Panna&apos; as letter), or bung the lecture to meet the girlfriends, and also by bringing neighboring girls to the hostel in absence of principal.(In reality, one of those girls will get pregnant in such situation.)By doing this he think he is doing a great thing for the boys and for the society.\n\nBy now, you must have understood what my problem is. They say at the end that a balance of discipline and love is required, but actually more weight in given to love, and the man with the discipline has negative shades in character. The next part of the movie is clear. These three students fail in their exam, or pass with the low score, and after college has problem in finding job, and very low knowledge for opening their own business. But the movie ends way before this happens.\n\nIt is good to give entertainment to the people, but then one should also pay the attention to what actually you are teaching. The movie which was released at the same time &quot;Mission Kashmir&quot; was having exactly opposite characteristics. The movie was having very less entertainment but gives out gives out good moral to the people. And again it is fact that &quot;Mission Kashmir&quot; flops and Mohobbatein was a great hit.

But he then decides to turn a small time singer into a rising star."",""","""After about two years after Rockstar I experienced almost the same effect with Aashiqui 2. It is much more dramatic like any conventional Hindi film. Heavy dialogues which will sometimes get you thinking. The script and story actually doesn&apos;t matter much when it gets the job done for the audience. The film has its own moments. Sometimes they will look a bit lame to you but ultimately the viewer will fall in love with them. I usually get a bit bored while watching Hindi films and this one kept me hooked, was more of an accomplishment.\n\nThe story is a bit well paced in the first half and keeps it grips the viewers with many different shots and then comes the second half in which the struggle with alcohol abuse is mainly focused and is shown excellently. Mohit Suri didn&apos;t wander into ridiculous depths to show the alcohol abuse but kept it strong, unlike Sanjay Leela Bhansali&apos;s Devdas. It wasn&apos;t required here because the movie didn&apos;t require it. The second half was jeweled with symbolic sequences and again gets the viewers thinking about alcohol abuse and its consequences.\n\nThe sound, the music was awesome and that&apos;s where I think I am comparing this film with Rockstar. The music of Aashiqui 2 knitted up the scenes spectacularly and made you high and low with it and in the end even got a lump in your throat and a teardrop in your eye.\n\nI won&apos;t say that acting was the forte&apos; of this film but the actors did a commendable job. Shraddha Kapoor&apos;s inncocent but pure dialogues and acting will keep you hooked.\n\nDespite of all the minor flaws. You will fall in love with this film without a doubt and that is what counts.\n\nI will give this film a 3.5 on 5 for a good package all together.

This seems like a fairly radical claim that I doubt they could really defend even though my knowledge of Hindi cinema is still far from complete. DIL SE seemed like a pretty honest examination of the subject to me, and that was several years earlier. I don&apos;t want to hold the claims on the DVD case against the movie though, as SARFAROSH is certainly an interesting take on the subject.\n\nAjay Singh&apos;s brother is killed and his father brain damaged by terrorists when Ajay is a small boy, because his father was going to stand up against them in court or something. Ajay takes this to heart (as you would), and as a young adult he devotes himself to becoming a police inspector and fighting against crime, and terrorists in particular. The movie is essentially about one case, where Ajay has to get to the roots of an operation smuggling guns into the country. The operation is backed by a Pakistani general, with the rationale that arming criminals in India is a cheap but effective way of waging war. The movie does push a fairly unbalanced &quot;Pakistan aggressors, India = victims&quot; message, though it is very careful/keen not to equate this with Muslim vs Hindu and turn it into a religious issue.\n\n The movie is fairly serious throughout - although there is a romantic interest (the lovely Sonali Bendre), it&apos;s not overplayed and does serve a useful function by building the character of Ajay and putting the case in the context of his life. For the most part though, the movie is focussed on the investigation and the encounters between the police and the criminals as they trace the criminal network closer to its roots. It&apos;s quite an action packed movie, and features some of the best action scenes I&apos;ve seen in an Indian movie. No bullet ballet or kung fu, but quite realistic fights and shootouts that are never-the-less very well choreographed and filmed. The movie bears an 18 rating, because the action does get quite violent. A lot of people die in the course of the movie, and a few of them in quite gruesome ways. One thing I&apos;ve noticed in quite a lot of Asian movies is that police violence is treated quite sympathetically - even as quite noble. The cops in Sarfarosh don&apos;t mess around - if threatening, beating or framing a criminal is the best way to get a result then they don&apos;t hesitate to do so. If a criminal happens to get killed in the course of an operation then they don&apos;t seem terribly upset either, unless it was somebody they wanted to interrogate .\n\nAjay Singh is played by Aamir Khan, an actor I haven&apos;t come across before. He&apos;s not a pretty boy by any means, but he does a very good job with the character. It&apos;s a good character too - well developed and believable, honorable without being sanctimonius. The rest of the cast all do a good job too, although Sonali Bendre doesn&apos;t have a lot to do except look pretty and dance around in the musical numbers.\n\nThe script for the movie is very tight, with both the criminals and the cops operations and motivations seeming quite convincing. The movie does veer a little towards preaching in places, especially towards the end, but this is forgivable. The direction is very confident and focussed, and sound and cinematography throughout are good throughout.\n\nAll round, a good movie worth seeking out."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Drama"",""Thriller""]","""1999-04-30""","""police,terrorist,face smashed against a mirror,singer,terrorism""","""2H54M""",23.0

To cut to the chase, Rustom can be watched for its story and most importantly Akshay Kumar, whose action/comic brilliance often overshadows his acting prowess.

Telling the story of a young Indian Muslim woman who follows her father&apos;s footsteps to become a spy by marrying into a Pakistani army family during the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war, Raazi is a gripping, taut thriller. The script is excellently written, infused with great detail and a fascinating glimpse into the complexity of the relationship between the two nations. The entire espionage track is handled with mastery and is only benefitted from the unpredictable proceedings, keeping the viewers hooked all through.\n\nRaazi breaks the paradigm of heroes and villains in the name of communal strife. The film highlights the characters as real people and makes sure to never glorify or demonise one side or the other based just on their nationality. The main protagonist, Sehmat, could be seen in either a positive or negative light depending on the personal stand of a given audience on the subject, and never are we explicitly encouraged to take sides. Are her actions moral? Is she a good person? All these questions are left to the viewer&apos;s conclusions, and opinions might be varied, but the human effect is always there, and setsting it apart from other gripping but shallow spy thrillers.\n\nMeghna Gulzar, herself the daughter of one of India&apos;s prime poets and film directors, does a fantastic job with Raazi both as a thriller and as the human story it ends up being. On all technical accounts, the film is excellent, be it the setting, the cinematography, or the music, but its dramatic urgency is equally as meaningful. Through its extraordinary story, Raazi lets the viewers contemplate on the concept of nationalism, which might tread a fine line between patriotism as in positive national pride and love of one&apos;s homeland, and then just pure jingoism. Some may say it advocates for pacifism, but we never know what it actually intends to convey.\n\nThe acting is just fine by one and all and, needless to say, it is Alia Bhatt who the film belongs to. The role of Sehmat, a woman who is on a mission which places her under constant pressure, is a challenge to any actress, and a young and pretty Bhatt really looks the part by virtue of her unassuming and trustworthy appearance. She is efficiently delicate all through, even phenomenal in some hard-hitting scenes, and although there are weaker moments here and there, her lack of experience turns out beneficial to her portrayal, particularly in view of Sehmat&apos;s blend of determination and inner conflict.\n\nVicky Kaushal, just like in real life, seems like a perfectly decent young man, one it&apos;s almost impossible to ascribe negative action or malice to. It&apos;s another case of a great casting choice, and he is just always so easy to like and sympathise with in a wonderfully understated performance. It goes without saying that it is his character that we end up feeling the most for. These two work well together, and even despite the minimal importance their romantic equation is given in this tense, political thriller, it manages to leave an ultimate mark. Do watch this absorbing film to see how it concludes."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Drama"",""Thriller""]","""2018-05-11""","""20th century,1970s,title directed by female,timeframe 1970s,timeframe 20th century""","""2H18M""",4.0

Whereas conventional Bollywood flicks are painted in colourful palette, Badlapur is done in shades of grey that is never afraid to go dark, but refuses to go white. Its darkness made me swoon on my seats. Its boldness enthralled me. This is the noir Bollywood has been waiting for. In Badlapur, the director has created two main characters that turn the very conventional ideas of protagonist and antagonist on its head and delivery a dark, comic, intense thriller that glued me to my seat in the first half, but falters in the second half where it tries to give intensity to the changing dynamics between the two main characters, but falters because the screenplay in the second half could not throw the same punch it did in the first half. The build up was definitely great and it showed itself in the stronger moments of second half, but as the story veered to its climax, it starts turning the whole revenge story upside down which is beautiful, but could not bring the same intensity and sharpness. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is the star of the movie. He is a phenomenon. Varun Dhawan comes second best. His acting is fine and his acting shows the intensity his character requires, but his voice does not live up to it. Overall, a must watch.

Gone are the days where you have a 100 people pop out of nowhere and join the actors in an impromptu dance. Gone are the days when a shower of petals across the screen would imply that people are making out. Well, at least, they should be gone.\n\n2015 is turning out to be a breathtaking year for Hindi Cinema. First we had &quot;Margarita, with a Straw&quot;, which, simply put, broke all stereotypes. And now we have Masaan, which makes Margarita look small. We have had a few amazingly touching and intense films in regional Indian cinema, with the likes of Ray, Kasaravalli, et al, but this is a whole new territory in Hindi Cinema.\n\nMasaan is devastatingly beautiful. Where do I even start? In the small North Indian town of Varanasi, the lives of a few ordinary people intertwine in two tales of love and loss. Right from the opening scene, we are thrown right into the tragic lives of these people, with an intensity hitherto unseen in Indian cinema, almost Scorsese like. It is so intense, that an air of discomfort fills the theater just 5 minutes from the opening. And that of unjust. Unjust, as we are forced to see the catastrophic consequences of corruption, greed, caste-ism, and people&apos;s attitudes towards sexuality. This is no pretty film. There are no scenes of comic relief. It gets into your head real quick, and you are all but mute spectators to their spiraling lives. You feel chained to your seats as you&apos;re unable to do anything for them. Now that&apos;s the power of good cinema.\n\nThe acting is almost perfect. Richa Chadda, as Devi, the bold woman caught up in sexual crime and corruption, is the star of the show. She pulls off the small town girl next door role with elegance and beauty, which only increases with her fearlessness as the film progresses. All the other actors, though not as good, are extremely believable in their respective casts. The direction is impeccable, with every small shot, be it romance or crime, captured with equal ferocity. But where the film truly stands out is in its cinematography. Avinash Arun Dhaware does in incredible job in capturing the holy city of Benaras in both its highs and lows. He sure is an expert in glorifying tragedy. The shots of the cremation at the ghats, the boat rides at night, and the train on the bridge are so hauntingly beautiful that they would remain etched on to my memory for quite some time.\n\nMasaan is a film that exposes you to the kinds of lives people elsewhere live, and gives you an opportunity to evaluate yours. It makes you ponder over issues, though a tad exaggerated, that people in certain parts of our country surely still face. It might also teach you a thing or two on love, loss and moving on. Although I haven&apos;t seen a lot of Hindi cinema, this might just about be the best that I have.\n\nUnfortunately, most people would still prefer a topless Salman Khan than a gem like this."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama""]","""2015-07-24""","""blackmail,love,interrupted sex,reference to facebook,train""","""1H49M""",7.0

Not much does it offer to adults. It does not mean the film is bad or something, I really enjoyed it for being a very well-made movie, but it&apos;s just not a film anyone would want to watch twice. To its credit, this is one of the only sci-fi films made in Hindi cinema, and it has succeeded as such. It benefits from great music, effective special effects, but above all, Hrithik Roshan&apos;s extraordinary performance as a mentally disabled young man. It also has lovely appearances from other actors, including Preity Zinta&apos;s light yet great portrayal of a modern young woman who learns to communicate with Hrithik&apos;s Rohit, and Rekha&apos;s moving act of his mother who is in a daily struggle with her son&apos;s defect. But these ladies succeed because they are two actresses of great screen presence. Otherwise the film was clearly made by Rakesh Roshan for his son. I frankly get a bit angered that all three of his films starring his son did not give any notable scope to other actors but were mainly created to promote Hrithik. The film is considered to be revolutionary, while clearly it is not. We had Mr India in 1987 which was in my view better at its time. Koi Mil Gaya is similar to E.T, but frankly pales in comparison. This Jaadoo, while a sweet creature, is plastic. BTW, he can&apos;t act (just kidding!).

Reviewing this film is no easy task; reviewing it objectively is even harder. This is because Krrish breaks many of the expectations of a western moviegoer. It&apos;s action is unusual, its acting is often exaggerated, not to mention that its in a foreign language! Getting a good perspective on the film is hard when it doesn&apos;t look anything like the movie one was looking for. So, let me just get my bias out on the table early on in this review. I loved it! I haven&apos;t laughed that hard in any action movie ever. I haven&apos;t seen fights that good in any comedy ever. Nor have I ever seen music videos like those in any sci-fi super hero flick. I love the crazy place this movie has found in terms of genre. This film moves easily from pop music video to manga-style action to touching drama to thought provoking sci-fi. It&apos;s just great.\n\nHowever, the bizarre amount of slapstick comedy, product placement/general commercialism, and constant switching of genre may very well put some western viewers off. This movie is not your usual super hero flick. Batman this is not.\n\nIt is, however, an excellent movie that combines the core elements of the super hero genre with romance, comedy, and sci-fi, and does this quite effectively, thanks to the good dialogue, great choreography and effects, and great acting and dancing by Hrithik Roshan and Priyanka Chopra.\n\nI was thoroughly entertained and would recommend this film to just about anyone who is willing to suspend disbelief, sit back, and enjoy the show."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Adventure"",""Sci-Fi""]","""2006-06-23""","""supernatural power,non comic book superhero,character name as title,child in jeopardy,one word title""","""3H5M""",16.0

Shahrukh Khan is one such actor. While he is more known for his larger than life films (such as &apos;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&apos;, &apos;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&apos;, &apos;Devdas&apos; etc) it is in roles such as Sunil, Raju (of &apos;Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman&apos;) or Rahul (of &apos;Yes Boss&apos;) that I prefer him most. &apos;Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa&apos; is one of his greatest achievements and among his most underrated films. He beautifully brings Sunil to life and had I not been aware that I was watching a movie, I wouldn&apos;t have known that Khan was acting. \n\nFor me, Sunil is one of the most unique and memorable characters in Hindi cinema yet he is so easily recognizable. He&apos;s not the son of a millionaire, not an A-grade student, not popular with women. He&apos;s vibrant. He&apos;s talented. He&apos;s carefree. He lies. He IS just a regular guy. One that you must have known sometime somewhere. I see a lot of myself in Sunil. His despair for Anna&apos;s love, his passion for music, his indifference towards his academic failure, have all been displayed with gusto by Mr. Khan.\n\nKundan Shah&apos;s direction is outstanding. He keeps everything including execution, story, props and setting, simple and that&apos;s what makes &apos;Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa&apos; so easy to relate to. His portrayal of Sunil&apos;s relationships with the people in his life that includes his family, his band members, the girl he loves, a priest and his boss is very real and down to earth. Thankfully, nothing is sugarcoated. Shah stays focused and does it all with a very subtle approach. Even the brother sister relationship which was given very little screen time, flourishes beautifully on screen and, in my opinion, it is one of the best depiction of a sibling relationship.\n\nThe background score flows very well with the film and the songs are great. My favourites include the ballad &apos;Sachchi Yeh Kahani Hai&apos; and the soulful &apos;Ae Kaash Ke Hum&apos;, both of which have been beautifully visualized. Actually all the songs are nicely picturized including the funny &apos;Kyun Na Hum&apos; and &apos;Anna Mere Pyar&apos;, the sad &apos;Woh To Hai Albela&apos; and the romantic &apos;Deewana Dil Deewana&apos;.\n\nThough &apos;Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa&apos; is Shahrukh Khan&apos;s film, most of the supporting cast is very effective. Naseeruddin Shah as the priest/Sunil&apos;s confidant is totally awesome. Tiku Talsania and Goga Kapoor are hilarious. Of Sunil&apos;s friend Kurush Deboo stands out. However, Suchitra Krishnamurty and Deepak Tijori are merely okay. \n\nIn a nutshell, &apos;Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa&apos; is one of my all-time favourite films. It&apos;s one of the rarest of its kind, truly a gem of a movie.""},""aggregateRating""","[""Comedy"",""Drama"",""Music""]","""1994-02-25""","""love,music group,lie,wedding party,unrequited love""","""2H38M""",28.0

Arshad Warsi not emotes well in comic scenes but is commendable in essaying serious role as well. Boman Irani , as usual , is marvelous. Saurabh Shukla as judge is simply fantastic.

Chak De Phatte!&apos; This is what you will hear loud and clear while watching this movie through out. &apos;Singh is Kinng&apos; is a true example of how you package the ordinary idea with loads of no-logic but damn funny humor, jazzed up with some peppy nos, put a big tag of superstar and wrap it up with oodles of hype. This movie has created history in breaking all time box office records specially. The mass hysteria of Akshay Kumar is unstoppable. He is the next big thing and currently, Indian movie industry is betting more than Rs 150 crores on him. \n\nThe story of &apos;Singh is Kinng&apos; is simple. Akki is a panic button for his village. People are so bugged with his non-sense that they decided to send him out of the village. They some how emotionally convinced him to go abroad and bring back another son of soil who is now an underworld don. Om Puri also got tagged along with Akki in this journey. In between, he meets his love interest Katrina and what follows is a no sense roller coaster ride where not only he has to bring the village son back to his roots but also, win his girl&apos;s heart.\n\nIt might sound nothing great then how come its such a big hit breaking all overseas records? The answer lies in two powerful words- Akki and the music. Akki aka Akhay Kumar is the current king of Bollywood. He is power packed and Singh is Kinng is a true example to prove it. He&apos;d hold the front all alone with his witty performance. Katrina too has her moments but just moments. Kiran Kher is a sheer waste of talent. Om Puri is just fine and Ranvir Shorey is something i don&apos;t even want to talk about it. What a waste of talent. Javed Jaffery is funny and played an interesting character. This movie is not focused on building characters because it can only happen with a good script. But here it&apos;s not about script but Akki and only Akki.\n\nMusic is really nice and has lots of variety. Pritam has done it again and has given another super hit soundtrack. &apos;Teri Or&apos; is a surprise delight with beautiful vocals, music and video. The reason why I like this song is not just the melody but an add on of some Rajasthani folk song playing in the background. Another interesting song is &apos;Jee Karda&apos;. Solid Punjabi beats forcing you to break free and just dance. It&apos;s extremely catchy. The title track could&apos;ve been better if they&apos;ve got some other singer than Mika. He did a horrible job. Snoop Dogg did his first act in Bollywood singing the remix version of title song which is way better than the original. Another very interesting song is &apos;Bhutani Ke&apos; which is very funny. It&apos;s a leg pulling song for the groom at his marriage. I can imagine this song getting played at every marriage and grooms just getting embarrassed.\n\nIt&apos;s an interesting movie and I advise every one to go with their group of friends and you&apos;ll be coming out laughing from the movie halls. Akshay has reached a status where he should take movies where he gets a support from a good script and some less silly things to be seen in the movie. Apart from this, i don&apos;t thing any other reason why you should not and go watch this full time pass movie."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Comedy"",""Crime""]","""2008-08-08""","""redemption,australia,punjab,punjabi,gangster""","""2H15M""",14.0

Cinematography is outstanding. Background score gels well with the mood of the film. Editing should have been better. Music is tuneful.\n\nOut of 3 main protagonist , Karthik Aryan and Sunny Singh stands out with superb performance. Both of them should be applauded for fine comic-timings. Omkar Kapoor does well as a new comer. Actress did justice to their part.\n\nPyaar Ka Punchnama 2 is a laugh ton which will be remembered for its utmost hilarious moments.

In order to keep his marriage procedures smooth, Nikhil must keep away Meeta away from the family but actually falls in love her.\n\nBollywood movies have always been woven around self-realization of whom you actually love ( believe me it happens only during the wedding ceremony) and Hasee Toh Phasee leaves no stone un-turned with typical bollywood potboiler. Screenplay is decent which is gripping in the first half but poor in the 2nd half. Cinematography is outstanding along with powerful art direction. Songs are just about OK. Silver-lining is the entertainment factor which first-time director Vinil Mathew succeeds in achieving. Few hilarious moments will tickle your funny-bone and that is enough to keep the ship sailing. Hats off to Parineeti Chopra for giving a fabulous performance. She is funny, emotes expressively and does a great job overall. Sidharth Malhotra still has a long way to go in terms of acting though he was better than Student of the year. Adah Sharma was looking gorgeous and was good in a small role.\n\nOverall, Hasee toh Phasee has entertainment quotient attached to it despite having few problems.

Corruption has become just as frequent as the summer sun shining over the equator. It&apos;s a regular occurrence in the workplace and this movie captures that effectively with a dose of humour. Naseeruddin Shah, Om Puri, Ravi Baswani, Pankaj Kapur, Bhakti Barve and Satish Shah deliver hilarious performances.

But I decided to give a try for it&apos;s International Version crafted by the XMEN 3 LAST STAND director Brett Ratner.\n\nI expected a mediocre typical Bollywood Stupid Musical Dance movie, but this one broke the mold. This movie will be remembered as the Trendsetter of Hindi films in the International Grounds.\n\nIt is a Rollar Coaster film, but with a Heart. I don&apos;t want to spoil all the story but it reminds me some of the movies like Stallone/Sharon Stone&apos;s Specialist, Mr &amp; Mrs Smith, Bonnie &amp; Clyde, even a Hindi film Daud, but all those stands down in-front of Kites.\n\nI don&apos;t know how the Hindi version would look like, how the conservative audience react to Kites. With some Intense Physical scenes and unique narration which really required for the story material, I think this movie is going to be a &quot;Love It or Hate It&quot; category.\n\nThe thing I don&apos;t like in this movie is the Love story itself, because it&apos;s too aimed for Female &quot;Twilight&quot; Audience who worships Romance. Other than that it&apos;s a Total Adrenaline movie, with great cast and good locations. The main leading man Hrithik Roshan I think is a well trained actor, with great physique and fight/dance abilities. This could be his &quot;Enter The Dragon&quot; in Hollywood.\n\nAlso I have to give credit for Brett Ratner for his experimental Remixed version for the Movie. With no Reshoots, just with the Original and unused material he made the perfect Crossover Product for an Asian film. By hiring composer Graeme Revell the movie got a new dimension and a fresh soul. The action scores and emotional themes heard in the movie were so brilliant, it definitely going to be Graeme Revell&apos;s best work after Daredevil and Freddy vs. Jason.\n\nMy recommendation only watch the International Cut. It&apos;s more cooler, edgy and Real. It is much shorter than the Asian version I heard and much stylish. Also it got no Dumb Song dance numbers (except the last one, which was done brilliantly by lead actor Hrithik Roshan).\n\nAnyway I give this movie 9 out of 10.\n\nKites = The Next Level"",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Drama"",""Romance""]","""2010-05-21""","""desert,casino,love,tragic event,suicide""","""2H3M""",12.0

And so, OBVIOUSLY, my expectations were low. You never know what you can expect from an original Bachchan movie! The credits began, and Jaya Bachchan could be heard individually pronouncing each name (the cast, the team behind the movie), and slowly, by the time she reached &quot;Writer and Director&quot;, you wished her to stop. And then, in a magical tone, she says &quot;Paa!&quot;, laughing along, and a soothing tone fills your ear and heart... and you know, yes, this is going to be a good show.\n\nPaa has its moments that touch you, that move you, that make you laugh, that make you feel warm, that make you happy... etc etc. There are moments that are supposed to make you cry... but they don&apos;t. I guess that&apos;s where Paa fails. Amitabh Bachchan in the lead role delivers a sweet performance, and Abhishek is seen trying very hard to fit in. Vidya sort of stumbles out of her &quot;Vidya&quot; character. The music of the movie is simple. The end credits song sung by Amitabh Bachchan was one amazing track. Even &quot;Hitchki&quot; was nice. The direction and flow was simple, though the cuts between Auro&apos;s waiting and Amol&apos;s political moves were rather jerky. The cinematography was simple and fulfilling, though the editing required spicing up.\n\nIn the end, definitely go watch Paa. I was disappointed to find only 15 had come for the first day first show... me being one. It&apos;s films like these that should be more prevalent. In contrast, if Kambakkht Ishq was a HIT, then in that case this should be a BLOCKBUSTER.

When the FBI trace major cocaine players to his district, Boyle is surprised to find that none of them are black or Mexican, but ends up assisting FBI agent Wendell Everett who, for his money, cannot work out if Boyle is really smart or really dumb.\n\nThe scenario with The Guard makes it sound like a standard fish out of water tale (with Everett being the fish) or another buddy-cop movie where two conflicting or bickering partners come together to solve the case. True, it has things in common with this genre in its dialogue and gun-fire, but this film is much more like someone took such a genre film and handed the script to the Cohen brothers and Graham Linehan to work on. The plotting is pretty straightforward here but it is the comedy that drives it. Those looking for the easy broad laughs suggested by the trailer might be disappointed because the film is funny because it has great characters and dialogue that is infuse with a wonderful Irish melancholy. Free of sentiment, the film is funnier for it because it is just so wonderfully odd.\n\nThe heart of the film is Brendan Gleeson and he owns it. He gets his character just right and has great comic timing and delivery, making the most of the dialogue which is wonderfully shocking and funny throughout. Writer and director McDonagh did an interview recently where he was acerbic and a little too honest about his feelings about his younger brother&apos;s success, and he uses this dark edge well in his writing, as well as mixing in visual and musical references to good effect; his script is as strong when it comes to one-liner jokes as it is in regards the brutal humour of his characters unsentimental realism. I&apos;m not sure how they got Don Cheadle on board, but he is pretty good and to his credit the Hollywood star knows that he is supporting Gleeson, which he does. The supporting cast has Cunningham and Strong as philosophising drug dealers and they are as good as the entire supporting cast because the script is great for all the characters.\n\nOverall, The Guard is a hard film to pigeonhole because while it is essentially a mismatched cop partner comedy, it is infused with a real oddness and dry Irish no-nonsense humour that works really well. Gleeson loves every minute of it and dominates the film while everyone wisely plays their part to support him in his lead role. McDonagh does a great job and The Guard will more than help him with his sibling rivalry.""},""aggregateRating""","[""Comedy"",""Crime"",""Thriller""]","""2011-07-07""","""ireland,small town,drug smuggling,galway ireland,mother son relationship""","""1H36M""",11.0

Humpty&apos;s father is the owner of a campus bookstore, where Humpty and his two best friends, Shonty and Poplu, have grown up together and which remains their hangout spot even now. Kavya is unattainable for Humpty initially, which makes her even more endearing to him. But being a Delhi boy, he is not the one to give up so easily. With some help from his two best friends, he finds out all about her and through an interesting turn of events (including a ploy to save Kavya&apos;s friend Gurpreet&apos;s marriage), they start growing closer to each other. The more time they spend with each other, their love-hate banter grows, but their chemistry is apparent. They are both different, yet very similar as people. They are young, feisty and carefree, and it&apos;s the spurge of life which attracts them to each other. As per plan, once Kavya&apos;s trip ends, she heads back to Ambala, knowing very well that her father, the very strict, yet loving Mr. Singh, would never accept her love for Humpty. But even though they both weren&apos;t looking for love, love happened.So Humpty,accompanied by his two friends, decides to go get Kavya. That&apos;s the beginning of a journey for him that he wouldn&apos;t have imagined undertaking even in the wildest of his dreams. Humpty, against all odds, decides to convince Kavya&apos;s family to agree to his alliance with her. How he does this and if he succeeds in his mission forms the rest of the story.

The ending is melodramatic, which is typical of Priyadarshan films. All the songs are poorly executed and, with the exception of the last three songs (&apos;Marjane&apos; being the best), they are horrible to listen to. Shahrukh Khan plays himself. Nothing new there. Lara Dutta is decent and she looks the part. But, it is Irrfan who manages to rise above the poorness of this movie. He is quite exceptional as the down to earth almost out of work barber and is the reason to watch &apos;Billu&apos;. Asrani and Om Puri are good in their roles.

He is a natural choice for Karwaan. Mithila Palkar is a great discovery - expressive, lively and ebullient. She stirs up a debate on semi-generation gap with Dulquer Salman that&apos;s utterly mouth watering.

Whilst he will never be a great actor, at least here he does an excellent job with a character that could have been a disaster. No over the top performance, this is a measured effort that conveys the character&apos;s inner turmoils very well.\n\nThe rest of the cast also do a fine job. Rishi Kapoor is always excellent and does a very creditable job as the head of the house. Dimple Kapadia plays his wife with sensitivity and purpose, although she is under utilised and perhaps underwritten and subservient in the screenplay. Anushka Sharma also does an excellent job in a role that could quite easily have devolved into a mess. I quite fancy that, on the evidence of her first four films, we may potentially be seeing the emergence of a new Queen of Bollywood.\n\nThe film itself is a very interesting look at the family in an Indian household in Southall, London, where traditional values are being undermined somewhat by the younger generation being more influenced by the cosmopolitan opportunities of a more accepting London than that which their parents faced.\n\nThe only real complaint I have with the film is that too many characters were brought to the fore and it results in a bit of confusion as to who is who. However, that aside, the screenplay is good, the film has a sense of purpose and moves forward at a nice pace. There is no unnecessary sentimentality brought into play and the end result is a film that does not scale great heights of classic cinema but is an eminently watchable film that deals with its subject matter very well."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama"",""Sport""]","""2011-02-11""","""violence,cricket sport""","""2H20M""",11.0

You may begin by showing how water fills up such a huge tank, the energy of flowing water and so forth. It is however important to note here that it is not the water alone but also the magnanimity of the tank, the height of the building etc. that must get to play an important role. Without an uncompromising projection of how huge the tank is, how it was carried over to the top of a large building and, so on, it will become impossible to feel the enormous presence of the water that fills it.\n\nAnd that would sum up how The Dirty Picture was executed. The energy of Vidya Balan in the central role was simply enormous. So much so, that the rest of the picture was unable to match up and consequently felt bland and weak in comparison. People often ask, if the writer writes the story, cinematographer films it, actors act and music director scores, what does the director get to do? The director must ensure that the energy of all people involved in the project is channelised in a single stream that gets projected on the screen and must be eventually, felt by the audience.\n\nDirector Milan Luthria fails miserably in his job here. A hammy comical Naseeruddin, a controlled Emraan Hashmi and a joke of a Tusshar Kapoor comprise the side characters around the unabashed and shamelessly unapologetic Vidya Balan. Her power over the crowd is merely shown each time by repeated shots of punching movie tickets, crowds of people rushing in and a different dance sequence on the screen. A shabby compromise! The promising biopic is not only slaughtered in its execution by the director but also in its clichéd screenplay (by Rajat Arora who adopts the same dialogue-styles from his previous OUATIM) that allows for an unnecessary narration sequence by Emraan Hashmi and a frequent spew of corny lines and witty (yet, effective) one-liners that end up disrupting the mood of the scene. The audience are however shamelessly satisfied without noticing the loose threads in the story. Like, what happened to the other character who sang with Silk? But who watched it for the story! People cheered when an extra half inch of Silk&apos;s bosom became visible or when she has finally got to kiss the medley of different heroes on screen. Special jeers and remarks for Hashmi&apos;s kiss. And I was in a multiplex hall.\n\nCinematography comprised of a sepia-ish hue to depict the 80s period in South India which went very well with the art direction but sadly, it avoided wider angled shots which could have been used to capture scenes involving Silk&apos;s audiences or at least to add authenticity to the period drama. This, coupled with the screenplay greatly limited the scope of this movie. The star power that the soft-porn star exhibited was neglected in various scenes. For instance, in the scene where Silk was creating a ruckus outside someone&apos;s house, the gathering of the crowd and their cheers were avoided and instead, the focus was on Naseeruddin, Tusshar and other star people involved. Better editing could have spiced up many of such shots.\n\nMusic score was mismatched and even slightly boisterous in some places.(I suspect that they must have hired the guy who gives those reaction sounds from Ekta&apos;s TV soaps for some of the scenes). Ooh La La was the only fun song. Honeymoon Ki Raat was a mind-boggler! Why was it even there? Sufiana was an unnecessary addition towards the end but they had to have it to show Hashmi kissing Balan.\n\nActing wise, however, this movie saves its face. Naseeruddin maintained the humour in the first half. Hashmi was consistent throughout. Tusshar was vapid and maintained a stupid look on his face in most of the scenes. Rajesh Sharma is indeed the discovery of the year. After a helpless police officer in No One Killed Jessica, he is unbelievably perfect as the B grade-ish producer. Expectedly, Vidya Balan saves the day by lifting the entire weight of the dirt of this picture and excelling herself as she has done in her past movies. Every performance since her past 3-4 movies has saved her movies from going noticeably awry. I was never a Balan fan from the start. But as of today, all I can say is that no one in Bollywood is in a position to make a picture that can sustain her energy and performance. It&apos;s like taking all the water meant to fill the Sintex tank and using it to fill your water bottle. The bottle is enough for you, not for the water.\n\nProducer Ekta Kapoor must have a really weird sense of humour. This movie that holds the vulgar expectations of the audience responsible for the rise and fall of Silk targets the very same from the audience of this film. And apparently she has hit the right spot. Sadly, this is apparently what &quot;Entertainment&quot; in a film is all about! When I walked in for a fourth day&apos;s show, many people around me were able to repeat various monologues by rote and in sync with the actors.

The climactic last scene of the epic, where Radha shoots her son in the back, while Birju was all set to kidnap the cruel money lender&apos;s daughter is a tragedy sequence that can be commensurately compared with the ending of another emotionally charged film - Shakti, where Dilip Kumar shoots in the back of his son &quot;Amitabh&quot;.\n\nHowever, Birju&apos;s angry performance in this movie steals the show at many a times; for instance, when he argues with his mother and brother about the greedy Bania moneylender who had fleeced their family from all earthly possessions through the odiously manipulative annual interest rate charged by him, although they have toiled day and night to return the debt.\n\nIt is a great melodramatic picture, containing magnificent performance by Nargis and Sunil Dutt, while manifesting the impoverished economic conditions and abysmal living standards of a typical Indian rural family who were driven in utter disgust, shame and tragedy due to the volatile temper of one of their family members. However, seething poverty was not the sole reason which perturbed Birju (Sunil Dutt) to become an outlaw and murder Sukhi Lala (the rapacious money lender), but the very ominous and cruel person hidden in the money lender, who, in a backward rural social setup took full benefit/advantage of the poor, illiterate and weak elements of village social order.\n\nBesides, the strong and moving story line, Faredoon has captured mesmerizing stills providing an excellent background setting of the full horizon picture down to the ground level with spreading murky clouds at dusk against the backdrop of silhouetted actors.\n\nIt is definitely a must see movie having marvelous and stupendous cinematography, as well."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Comedy"",""Drama""]","""1957-10-25""","""holi,remake by original director,village,poverty,field""","""2H52M""",65.0

So add liberal doses of silliness, unnecessary plot complications, shrillness, crassness, slow motion fight sequences and many, many blown up vehicles. Also add a few sequences &amp; a few jokes that really make you laugh. Just pray that the cringe-worthy moments don&apos;t outnumber the LOL moments &amp; that depends entirely on your sensibilities. \n\nThe broad outline of the original story is retained. Ajay Devgn, local tough &amp; rich landlord, employs Abhishek as a supervisor. Unfortunately, Abhishek, a Muslim in the film, has to pretend to be a Hindu in front of Ajay. One lie leads to another and soon he has to invent a gay, Muslim identical step brother, a mother, the mother&apos;s identical twin sister etc. Prachi, Ajay&apos;s sister, is Abhishek&apos;s love interest. Asin, Abhishek&apos;s sister, is Ajay&apos;s love interest. And Jeetu Verma is there as Ajay&apos;s evil cousin only so that muscles can be rippled and bones broken. Neeraj Vora as Ajay&apos;s sidekick and Asrani and Krishna as Abhishek&apos;s uncle and son, respectively are there to attempt to wring a few more laughs from you. \n\nAjay&apos;s character likes to speak English and mangle it beyond belief, and this ability provides many of the comic, funny moments of the film. You watch in awe, wondering what he will come up with next, a bit like when you watch Sidhu comment on cricket. It works in short doses and appears a bit stretched in the second half. &apos;When elders get cozy, youngsters don&apos;t put nosy&apos; or &apos;Thank you for the Complan Boy&apos; (compliment) don&apos;t seem rib tickling but given Ajay&apos;s fulsome delivery and the situation, it does generate quite a few laughs. \n\nAbhishek plays his two roles quite straight, pun intended. The sequence where the gay character has to dance to a medley of songs in unison with two of Ajay&apos;s henchmen is crass but makes you laugh in parts. Asin is strangely muted in the film, while Prachi also has a small role, without much meat. \n\nThe movie is too long, the songs aren&apos;t great, the fight sequences too similar to what we&apos;ve already seen from Rohit Shetty&apos;s earlier films. There is a vision here to make it a comedy for the masses and judging by the loud laughs from the audience, he&apos;s got it right. \n\nI feel, with the same cast, just keeping it along the lines of the original could&apos;ve worked just as well, but I fear I would be in the minority in the industry. Would love it if there was a face-off between an intelligent, well made comedy (like a Vicky Donor, Khosla ka Ghosla) &amp; a &apos;mass&apos; one like this, with similar level of star power in both. I wonder which film would then have a bigger box office ? More at www.apurvbollywood.blogspot.in"",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Comedy""]","""2012-07-06""","""child""","""2H35M""",10.0

Spending so much on location, songs and dance would not give inception of a good film unless script is thoroughly worked upon. There is no definition of Story, Script and direction tin Judwaa 2.

They spend the most magical dream-like days of their lives in that town... with each other."",""","""&apos;Saawariya&apos; was one of those over-hyped films that I thought of skipping. Not because of the hype but because of Sanjay Leela Bhansali. Bhansali&apos;s debut venture &apos;Khamoshi The Musical&apos; remains one of my favorite film. After that he made &apos;Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam&apos; which for me was merely a one-time watchable film. This was followed by &apos;Devdas and &apos;Black&apos; which were awful. The reason why I finally watched it was because I didn&apos;t have to pay. So what did I think? I didn&apos;t like the film.\n\nOn the technical side, &apos;Saawariya&apos; is well made. The cinematography, lighting etc work are quite impressive. The set design is spectacular but looks fake (works for something like &apos;Moulin Rouge&apos;). The film is set in some kind of France-Italy combo inhabited by Indians. For obvious reasons, Bhansali gives the film a blueish tint. However, &apos;Saawariya&apos; is the kind of movie that required a more subtle treatment than the operatic loudness.\n\nSo where exactly does it fail? The story. There&apos;s no soul. It&apos;s extremely slow (and uninteresting as it&apos;s obvious what will happen) and knowing that it may have been ripped off from Visconti&apos;s &apos;Le Notti Bianche&apos; doesn&apos;t do anything for the liking. The numerous references to the Kapoor family looks forced. Again, Bhansali presents the lead heroine as the flawless &apos;adarsh bharatiya naadi&apos; (typical traditional Indian woman), who is coy and innocent, makes sacrifices and whatever. He did the same with Aishwarya and Madhuri in his previous films.\n\nSonam Kapoor is passable in some scenes but in other scenes it appears as if she&apos;s on weed, e.g. especially because of her constant giggling. Perhaps this is a reference to some kind of madness as Imaan may be a &apos;symbolic&apos; representation of that (suggesting that Imaan does not exist). However, this aspect is not explored and why would Imaan be a representation of madness? The character is one of the dullest I&apos;ve seen in recent cinema and the viewer is left wondering what it was about Imaan that got Sakina so obsessed. Say even, if Sakina was mad, her acting out of the symptoms looks unreal. Yet, there may be room for improvement depending on her future film choices and directors. Ranbir Kapoor really overdoes his act, trying too much to look lovable and sympathetic. I can see that the actor really is trying (perhaps too much) but his expressions and moves just don&apos;t look natural and all those references to RK movies flooding the screen do not help. Salman Khan personifies wooden. In a small role, Zohra Sehgal is okay. In the end, it is Rani Mukherjee&apos;s performance that leaves an impact. She is absolutely fantastic. Her scenes really are worthwhile. She completely nails the part. Although in that same year, she does play a prostitute in &apos;Laaga Chunari Mein Daag&apos;, the actress really does make both characters unique. She looks and acts the part (looking pretty hot).\n\nAlthough I didn&apos;t like the film, there were a few enjoyable moments (that I mentioned above) and I was doing something else at the same time, so it wasn&apos;t a full waste of hours. I can see why many would like the film because it is pretty to look at but it has no heart. In my opinion, &apos;Saawariya&apos; is forgettable and it does not deserve more than a one-time watch.""},""aggregateRating""","[""Drama"",""Musical"",""Romance""]","""2007-11-09""","""prostitute,unrequited love,muslim,bollywood musical,eid""","""2H22M""",15.0

This charming movie is just like a gust of fresh air where love is innocent, the lovers are having hearts of gold and even their family members are no stereotyped villains. Troubles are there, confusions are there, indecisiveness is there, misunderstandings and consequential quarrels are there but the most important thing is that everything is realistic and everybody is human. And to err is human, we all know.That&apos;s the quality which makes this movie a winner.\n\nSocha Na Tha (not thought of) is the love story of a confused young boy Viren (Abhay Deol) and an orphan girl fostered by her uncles and aunts - Aditi (Ayesha Taakia). Their parents / guardians want them to get married with each other but they have other plans. On one hand, Aditi likes someone else (Shaayan Munshi), on the other, Viren feels infatuated to a Christian girl - Karen (Apoorva Jha). Viren seeks the help of his sister-in-law (Ayesha Zulka) to get out of the proposed matrimonial alliance with Aditi and finally manages not only the consent of Karen but also her parents as well as his parents for their marriage. But meantime, Viren and Aditi have become friends. Now Viren expressively and Aditi silently feel that in fact, they have fallen in love with each other. Innocent Viren with a clean heart does many illogical things to first repel Karen and her parents and then do the repair work in case of Aditi. However the misunderstandings between their families keep on increasing. Finally, they go away from each other. Viren transforms himself into a mature and successful youth but now Aditi who was earlier much more mature and sensible than Viren, approaches him to unite with him. What happens thereafter is the climax.\n\nThe theme of this movie reminds me of a very old black and white comedy - Chacha Zindabaad (1959) starring Kishore Kumar and Anita Guha. However this movie does not at all appear to be a copy of that old movie or any other movie. It has an originality of its own, courtesy the fresh style of treating the story idea.\n\nTeenage and just after that is that time of a normal person&apos;s life when the heart wants to fly in the air. Let someone become mine. Let myself become someone&apos;s. Let&apos;s sing love songs. Let&apos;s release sighs when not together. But it takes time to realize as to what actually one wants. It cannot be understood within a short span of time as to who is or can be your real soulmate. And that&apos;s the message of Socha Na Tha.\n\nDirector Imtiaz Ali has been fully successful in his mission of presenting a touching and lovable rom-com. Hilarious moments are there. Laughs are there. Tender feelings are there. Emotions are there. But as I have said earlier, there are no villains. The negatively behaving people are also not wrong from their viewpoint. The late understanding of things as well as the immature actions of the protagonist create misunderstandings that result in negative reactions of those who are in one way or the other, related to the lead pair. In fact, all the characters involved in the script are good by heart. The ending scene evidences it in the most simple and straight manner.\n\nNow I am surprised where this young director has lost his touch and the skill to pick the pulse of the young and educated generation. Socha Na Tha is a movie which you will love like anything if watch with not so high expectations. As far as I am concerned, I felt like flowing with the lead characters and the things happening to (and by) them in the story, empathizing with them. Love is like the fresh cow milk when innocent. And let&apos;s not allow its innocence to be tainted by any means.\n\nThis movie, produced by Dharmendra, has a good production value and technically perfect. The music of Sandesh Shandilya is completely in sync with the mood of this romantic movie and all the tunes are melodious and lovely. However they do not possess the quality to remain in mind when the movie is over. The beautiful and touching lyrics of the songs (coming from the pens of Irshaad Kaamil and Subrat Sinha), if listened to with attention, are able to strike a chord in the listener&apos;s heart.\n\nAbhay Deol has proved in his debut movie itself that he&apos;s the horse for a long race. With his long hair and innocent raw face, he not only looks dashing but his performance is so impressive as if he was born before a camera. Ayesha Taakia, with her childish looks, is not far behind. The movie has one more Ayesha - the veteran heroine, Ayesha Zulka as the Bhabhi of the hero and she has done exceedingly well in the meaty role assigned to her. The complete supporting cast has done justice to the respective roles but mainly the movie belongs to the lead pair which has lightened up the screen with its amazing chemistry.\n\nIt&apos;s painful for me to know that this brilliant romantic movie was a commercial failure. May be due to poor marketing. However true to its title, any viewer of this movie (including me) had not thought of liking it so much. If not for some repetition of things in the later part of the movie and the absence of some memorable songs, I would have awarded it a five star rating. It&apos;s virtually a heart-conquerer. If your heart beats for someone special, you can watch it any number of times without getting bored."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Drama"",""Romance""]","""2005-03-04""","""love,wedding,falling in love,boyfriend girlfriend relationship,interfaith relationship""","""2H17M""",17.0

The director was Vijay Anand younger brother of Dev Anand, who reluctantly accepted the task and changed the location to Udaipur, also called the Pink City, for its ornate pink palaces and now a tourist mecca. The partnership was called Navketan International. Navketan International even handled the advertising for this movie, which was pioneering and unique even for the &apos;60s. The actor playing &quot;Raju&quot; was none other than,Devdutt Pishorimal Anand, Aka Dev Anand, Evergreen Anand, Dev Saab, an English major who trekked his way to Bombay (now Mumbai) the &quot;Hollywood&quot; of India now inaptly titled &quot;Bollywood&quot;. Dev Anand was accepted by the Indian moviegoers instantly since he had chiseled features (mixture of Gregory Peck &amp; Rock Hudson!)wore hats at a rakish angle,walked sort of sideways! and spoke Hindi with a clipped and poetic accent. Being handsome compared to some actors who were cherubic! didn&apos;t do any harm either.

She too was reluctant in accepting the part that had, lot of insinuations and was considered a bad career move. Accepted she did and the rest is history, a cinematic masterpiece caught in Eastman color by cinematographer Jal Mistry. There is a scene, where, Raju (Dev Anand,) is drunk and sings his heart and soul to Rosie (Waheeda Rahman) who has emotions crushed between a pillow and she walks down the stairs and their hands meet between rails. This was the master director Vijay Anand at work using haunting melody of music that was the staple of great music directors like &quot;Dada&quot; Sachin Dev Burman, whose music will linger for ever. &quot;Guide&quot; is a movie you will treasure, to be taken out and watched once in a while, lest we forget the fact that there were gifted craftsmen who made great movies, when movie art was a passion practiced by chosen few.

Amitabh and Dhanush are both nothing short of brilliant in their respective roles, but i think the story is flawed in many areas and just doesn&apos;t grab your attention. I&apos;m not sure how big Dhanush will be in Bollywood, but he clearly has created a niche for himself. Without a single dialogue, he matches Big B in terms of his screen presence so well. He is full of expression and very energetic. Amitabh, as always is the soul of the film. Not only is his acting just top notch but when you watch Dhanush, but hear Amitabh&apos;s voice you remember just how amazing his voice actually is. Akshara wasn&apos;t as a bad as I thought, but she does not have the looks to go far in Bollywood.

The film is a true cinematic experience in terms of aesthetics, and be it the black-and-white or the colour version, it is an unforgettable visual treat. The sets, the costumes, are stunningly lavish, almost to the point of casting a gloom over the story itself. And then we have the story, an epic, poetic one, which involves a most subtle love story. The dialogue is stupendous, with many lines having a memorable, larger-than-life quality which enhances the narrative beyond imagination. The music is similarly fantastic, with spectacularly performed dance numbers. Needless to say, &quot;Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya&quot; is the high-point of the film and the story it tells. Prithviraj Kapoor is excellent in a wonderfully dramatic and appropriately theatrical performance as Emperor Akbar. Dilip Kumar seems to enjoy his own, mere presence, while underplaying his role to great effect. It is Madhubala, however, who walks away with the most fully-realised part of Anarkali, a slave girl whose dignity cannot be taken away at any cost. I found the film a greatly entertaining watch, and while I had a problem with its overlong running time, as well as some faulty sequences, such as the less convincing battle between the father and son, Mughul-E-Azam remains a meticulous piece of art, and a rightly-touted all-time classic of Indian cinema."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama"",""Romance"",""War""]","""1960-08-05""","""love,16th century,mughal empire,emperor,prince""","""3H17M""",62.0

Hilarity and adventure ensues."",""","""Amar, Akbar and Anthony are separated from their family and from each other as small children, and each is raised separately and in a different faith. Amar is raised a Hindu and grows up to become a police officer, Akbar is raised a Muslim and grows up to become a Qawaali singer whilst Anthony is raised Christian and grows up to be a small time hoodlum.\n\nMost of the movie is focussed on the character of Anthony, which is fine by me since he is played by Amitabh Bachchan - surely the most charismatic actor India has ever produced.\n\nAs adults, none of the brothers have any idea of their familial origins, but believe their parents to be dead. To make matters worse, each parent thinks the other is dead and both think their children are dead. It must be said that they didn&apos;t go to great lengths to discover this, but the film would hardly have worked if they had so that&apos;s one piece of disbelief that has to be suspended. It&apos;s not the last one, as the film is wholly guided by a series of coincidences that gradually has the various members of the family crossing each others paths. I suppose one is encouraged to believe that these coincidences are orchestrated by the fates or a higher power, but putting it down to dramatic convenience worked just as well for me.\n\nAlso brought into the plot are the loves of the three brothers, for the requisite romance and feminine wisdom. The boys are lucky enough to have secured the affections of a bevy of beauties, and the actresses add a nice touch of glamour and colour to the film. In addition to and intersecting with these we have the evil villain of the piece, carrying the terribly intimidating name of &quot;Robert&quot;.\n\nAt 175 minutes, Amar Akbar Anthony has plenty of time to flesh out its characters and develop the plot in a well paced fashion. The movie goes through many different moods and emotions, but after the first 15 minutes of melodrama the tone is generally kept light and pleasant.\n\nAs well as the romance and drama, the movie has a few moments where it shifts into action territory - Anthony especially has a knack for getting into a scuffle. The fights are very imaginatively choreographed but terribly executed, looking very staged and faked. This all adds to the fun of them though. There&apos;s also the songs of course, though not too many - especially in the first half of the film. Some of these are very catchy and the dance choreography cheerfully engaging.\n\nAlthough it has something of an ensemble cast, there is no question that the movie belongs to Amitabh. His character is the most complicated and interesting, and his performance the most subtle and engaging. He gets all the best lines, too. He won the &quot;best actor&quot; award for this role, and it is largely for his performance that the movie is considered an Indian classic.\n\nLike many Indian movies that run in the three hour range, there&apos;s something in AAA for everybody, and Amitabh&apos;s charisma especially means that it never grows wearisome. Although the first half an hour didn&apos;t have me terribly engaged, the film does just keep getting better and better (and more imaginative) as it progresses. I had to constantly keep upgrading my rating for the film as I watched. By the time the movie reaches its climax, it has managed to weave everything together so well that I was thoroughly delighted to be watching it.\n\nRecommended!"",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Comedy"",""Drama""]","""1977-05-27""","""murder of a priest,heiress,muslim,hindu,coincidence""","""3H4M""",45.0

After a while it also got pretty irritating to hear words like &quot;Exactly&quot; and &quot;Sorry&quot; over and over again. The worst part of the movie was the ending. Abhishek Bacchan seemed totally unnecessary in the movie. I wonder what made him chose this role! The ending could have been a little more graceful and all the chaos in the hospital was totally unwanted and rather unpleasing to watch. Saif, Arshad and Tania go a good job.

Ripped apart by jealousy, Gopal deserts Radha."",""","""Gopal&apos;s (Shahrukh Khan)performance as a hard worker, responsible, romantic and a neglected husband was Outstanding.\n\nRadha&apos;s (Maduri Dixit)performance as an unloving, uncaring and not understanding wife was Excellent.\n\nMusic, songs and dances were lovely and lively.\n\nGopal is a successful and prosperous business man. At the same time, he was a neglected husband because his wife Radha was obsessed with her Best friend, Suraj (Salman Khan); was overly concerned about him and was extremely busy taking care of him.\n\nSuraj was a famous and demand singer but he depended on Radha for his emotional support.\n\nOn the second day of their marriage, Suraj who was in his thirties called Radha because he was having stomach problems and didn&apos;t know what to do about it. Negleting her husband, Radha was too busy giving her Best friend, Suraj step by step instructions how to take care of his stomach problems. She also told him to call her back if he was not better or gotten worse. How sweet!\n\nAfter their wedding, Radha did not prioritize her relationships with her husband, brother and her Best friend. She always found the time for her Best friend, Suraj as to the point their behaviors interfered in their marriage.\n\nAt first, Radha did not want to go to Switzerland for their honeymoon because it was too far away, it was very cold and she got motion sickness. As soon as she found out Suraj was also going to Switerland, she became exceptionally excited to go to Switzerland for their honeymoon. She complimented her Best friend Suraj all the time but never complimented her husband, Gopal.\n\nIt is appropriate for married people to have friends with opposite gender but there should be an agreement between husband and wife to have friends. There was no agreement between Gopal and Radha for her to continue her friendship with her Best friend, Suraj. Her husband, Gopal was the last person on her list of relationships. A married husband had to burn his finger on a hot pan on the stove to get his wife&apos;s attention.\n\nGopal did not display any behavior problems before their marriage and he was not a &quot;Complexed Man or a Bloody Weirdo&quot;.\n\nA bedroom is someone&apos;s private space. Married or not married, a bedroom is not the appropriate place for brothers, sisters, parents and friends to communicate and to socialize with each other. There are common areas and rooms in a house where they could have communicated and socialized.\n\nIt was improper for Radha&apos;s brother to enter their bedroom and to sit on their bed to communicate with his sister, Radha. It was inappropriate behavior for Radha to invite her Best friend, Suraj into her bedroom. It was unacceptable behavior for her Best friend, Suraj to enter her bedroom. It was indecent for Suraj to take his shirt off in Radha&apos;s and Gopal&apos;s bedroom. Suraj and Radha respect personal boundaries.\n\nIt was so mean for Radha to give Suraj the shirt that she had bought for her husband, Gopal during their honeymoon. Later, Radha offered her husband, Gopal the red shirt that no one wanted.\n\nRadha made a number of phone calls to Suraj on a daily basis but she never called her husband. Radha couldn&apos;t remember whether or not her husband liked coffee or tea but she remembered that Suraj liked Horlicks and wanted to make it for him. Suraj gave a birthday party for Gopal&apos;s wife when they were separated.\n\nYes, those were little things but little things add up. Radha was faithful but she never told Gopal that she loved him the most. Radha&apos;s and Suraj&apos;s inappropriate behaviors that they had displayed had definitely affected Gopal&apos;s emotional health.\n\nBecause Gopal was feeling jealous, was feeling insecure and was feeling inferior about his marriage with Radha, he wanted to able to sing like Suraj. After hearing Gopal singing, Radha laughed at him and told him that he didn&apos;t know how to sing but Suraj was an excellent singer.\n\nGopal loved his wife very much and was faithful husband to Radha. It was not appropriate for his Administrative Assistant to confide her marital problems to her boss and a married man, Gopal.\n\nYes, she had the right to love Gopal and no one could stop her from loving him, but he didn&apos;t have to accept her love. Even when she had made advances toward Gopal, he had rejected her advances.\n\nIntentional or intentional, Suraj and Radha had misbehaved. They didn&apos;t examine their behaviors, but chose to label Gopal as a &quot;Complexed Person&quot;, &quot;Bloody Weirdo&quot;, Suspicious Nut&quot; and &quot;Crazy Man&quot;.\n\nSuman who had never met Gopal said that he was not a good man; he was not a good husband and he was an arrogant man. She was not bothered by how many phone calls Suraj had made and received.\n\nShe was not bothered by it only because she was not engaged or married to Suraj. Suraj is still a &quot;free man&quot; and she had no right over him.\n\nYes! There is always a woman behind every successful man but Radha was obsessed with Suraj as to the point she neglected her husband.\n\nWhen people get married, relatives and friends should back off a little to provide them the space and privacy they need to adjust to their married life.\n\nDivorce was not the answer. It was good that Gopal asked Radha to leave because separation can give people the needed space and time to reexamine their behaviors and to sort out their feelings. I am happy that everyone who was involved was able to ask for forgiveness and to receive forgiveness each other."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Drama"",""Romance""]","""2002-05-24""","""false accusation,anger,dysfunctional marriage,suspicious husband,childhood sweetheart""","""2H54M""",20.0

And the main attraction was Rohit Dhawan, he is the brother of Varun but not only that, he is a good director. His previous venture was Desi Boyz, which is a comedy movie but different story line and not a backdated storyline. These all things made me very curious about the film but you have to remember the saying, &quot; All that glitters is not gold&quot;. This movie had a lot of opportunities to execute but the director didn&apos;t utilize them well. \n\nI am not telling this is a dumb and boring movie or the direction is bad. I just want to say that there are lots of missed opportunities taken by the director and if the director would take them properly, The movie would be more enjoyable and funny. \n\nFor nowadays Bollywood is looking for numbers and stars. Not asking acting or fundamental storyline. They just demand the box office performance and the publicity. This movie publicized well and there are huge star cast in this movie which is also favorable for box office. But if you don&apos;t concentrate the details and storytelling style you have to suffer. Maybe you will have a good opening at the box office but after ending the weekend you will loose profit.\n\nThe movie starts with a good pace and the first half is quite good for comedy movie lover. The movie also keeps a good pace till the intermission and sometimes maybe you feel the suspense and the thrill which the director wanted to give you but after the intermission, the pace slowed and the second half is ridden by unnecessary dialogues and cliché twists. There is at least 15 unnecessary scene which would be edited. The twists and the story bending is almost predictable and sometimes the lead actors made some overacting.\n\nPerformance-wise John is OK. Varun is OK but if he avoids the overacting he would be good, Jacqueline is very cliché and she have to learn what acting is and body showing is not acting. Akshaye Khanna is good and he did nothing new for this role but I think almost it is a good comeback for him. Direction for Rohit Dhawan is OK but could have been better. Editing should be more polished and the screenplay was not bad. Songs are OK but not great. Overall it is OK movie and maybe the casting will make this a profitable one.

I would say the three altogether make one of the finest movies ever made in India. And it would not be wrong to say that it is the best Indian movie of the year. \n\nThe performances are very real.

However, after the brief introduction to each, the audience is quickly taken on a ride with the duo, Bunty and Babli, as they travel from city to city cheating people out of their money. Abhishek does a terrific job as Bunty and of course Rani is perfect as his accomplice, Babli. The film has enough laughs to last through to the very end. Even Amitabh, the veteran Indian actor, is comedic in his role as the police officer chasing the two. Aishwarya&apos;s dance number was a pleasant addition to the film.

However after watching it in an almost full theater of mostly college students, I was somehow disappointed &apos;in the end&apos; since the film neither had anything Pure (Shuddh) or Tratitional (Desi) nor truly Romantic in its 140 minutes of content, revolving around Live-In relationships to be precise. So since the main focus of the film was all around casual flirting, pre-marital sex and live in relationships, I strongly felt the title of the film just opposite to its concept as SHUDDH DESI ROMANCE very frankly.\n\nBesides, this is the first time ever that I felt the writing of Jaideep Sahni (Story, Screenplay, Dialogues &amp; Lyrics) very confusing and unconvincing with every single character of his, not exactly knowing what he/she really wants in his/her life and who do they love from their heart seriously. But fortunately, a viewer gets to think all this in a negative mode, only when the film reaches in its last 30 minutes and not before that.\n\nTherefore, the good news is that till the complexities between its three leading characters reach their concluding moments, the viewers have nothing to complain at all as far as entertainment is concerned. And the film undoubtedly remains a fairly enjoyable venture both before and after the intermission with many entertaining sequences &amp; dialogues to keep you glued. But once it reaches the finale, all the fine build simply crashes down with some absurd decisions taken by its characters and a very weird kind of conclusion is there promoting an entirely different concept of the present society (i.e. the live in relationships) which is certainly not any SHUDDH DESI ROMANCE as they have named it.\n\nSo if you are just interested in having a good time in the theater, laughing at all the unjustified &amp; highly unrealistic kind of scenes, wherein everyone is behaving in a confused or weird manner, then SDR might interest you a lot since it is exactly packaged to provide the same. It has some great intimate kisses, many hilarious dialogues in a local lingo and some good performances too. But in case you are interested in watching an exceptional love story with a deep emotional base supported by a realistic logic then you might get disappointed like myself as the end credits start rolling.\n\nHaving said that, the smart thing about the film is, that it actually never makes you feel the absurdity till the last few minutes. And its only when the film is over, that you are forced to think &quot;Yaar, Yeh Hua Kya?&quot;, followed by more questions about the entire storyline which have no logical answers at all in the film itself. For instance, a young man runs away from his marriage&apos;s mandap just before the &quot;Jai-mala&quot; and knowing it, the immensely beautiful bride takes it very casually and asks for a Thanda instead! Now there are many more similar sequences in the film which certainly have no realistic reasoning behind them, not expected from a project written by Jaideep Sahni. But maybe this time the writer and his director were more interested in making the people laugh on these absurdities only, quite intentionally for a change.\n\nAnyway, though its basic plot is just the same (of confused partners), the film is still presented in a highly likable manner and I too enjoyed it a lot in its initial hour. But towards the final half an hour, the interest was all lost, leading to an utterly confused conclusion, supported by no reason at all. Actually SDR keeps progressing at a very calm pace without any peaks of excitement in the script. Yet it majorly keeps you entertained because of the loving chemistry between its three charming characters and their natural performances. As a strong merit, there are no dull moments in the film at all with many hilarious dialogues in its initial 90 minutes. Still at times one might think that there is too much talking going on instead of Pure Romance in a repetitive mode. \n\nMusically SDR has some good tracks but also has a signature tune in the background music exactly similar to the notes of &quot;Kiklee Kaleer Di&quot; from LUV SHUV TE CHICKEN KHURANA. Thankfully the songs don&apos;t come into the narration abruptly, which is another saving grace of the film and Cinematography also provides a good support capturing the local feel brilliantly.\n\nIn performances, Sushant Singh is remarkably natural and impresses once again post KAI PO CHE!. He is fresh in looks and gets some great lines to woo the audience too.Parineeti Chopra is fine with another of her &apos;bindaas, spontaneous&apos; performance playing the bold &amp; beautiful. She is no doubt good but now needs to move on, away from her typical &apos;Carefree&apos; persona displaying some different acting skills in her next projects. Rishi Kapoor is lovable as usual and Rajesh Sharma does it well once again. But the surprise element in the film is Vaani Kapoor who looks stunningly gorgeous and amazingly confident in her very first performance on screen and could have made much more impact with a better role written for her (having some logical reasoning).\n\nTo sum it up, SHUDDH DESI ROMANCE is a young film at heart particularly aiming at the youngsters with many light, entertaining moments to win over them smartly (overstepping the Indian traditional setting of a marriage). It could have been a great film, if it had a more logical conclusion given to the 3 confused characters in the final reels. But in the present form, it has a winning build-up, the impact of which gets more or less ruined by a weird and irritating climax quite surprisingly."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Drama"",""Romance""]","""2013-09-06""","""love""","""2H21M""",9.0

But sadly this time too, he follows his same old path of inspired themes and copied scenes and comes out with a film which is tailor made only for the multiplex and college going audience.\n\nRight from the release of its first look, the film gave out few negative signals as its initial poster was straight away a copy of &quot;An Education&quot; (2009) with the genders changed, which was later pulled off due to its criticism. And today on its release, when the movie started on the screen, it&apos;s very first scene was exactly a copy of the French movie &quot;Girl on the Bridge&quot; (1999) with again the genders changed. The moment I saw this exactly similar execution of the scene as in the French film, my whole excitement to watch ANJAANA ANJAANI vanished into the thin air and I simply felt like cheated.\n\nI agree 90% of the audience would surely be not aware of this truth and neither would they be interested in knowing about it. But it does affect my watching experience of a movie when I see an entire sequence simply lifted from another source of World Cinema, without any kind of courtesy note or acknowledgment. So for me, ANJAANA ANJAANI failed from that very moment and it is simply made on the same formula of Siddharth Anand, which more or less remains dependent on ingredients taken from its VARIOUS SORUCES. Though after its opening lifted scene, the film moves on to different path talking about the relationship between the lead pair. But undeniably its main subject and theme is quite close to the original &quot;Girl On The Bridge&quot; on the whole (with also a reference to &quot;The Bucket List&quot;).\n\nMoving ahead of this inspirational angle, ANJAANA ANJAANI does try to incorporate something fresh on the screen, with only the two lead characters in its script till the end. But the problem is that along with its novel theme, the director still keeps clinging to the ages old love formulas of Hindi Cinema, wherein the realization of true love comes towards the climax and the movie ends as usual with a rushing airport sequence. Now this raises a logical question that if we are intelligent enough to get inspired from such beautiful masterpieces made in the other parts of the world, then why we keep on adding our own rotten and overused formulas into it which totally ruin an otherwise good project in the end. The process simply takes away the beauty of the subject and results in a poor project in comparison to its worth watching original.\n\nOn a positive note, ANJAANA ANJAANI has surely got some original entertaining moments showcasing few bold discussions going on between the couple. But these moments are not consistent throughout the movie and there are several dull moments too which spoil the spirit of the movie as a whole. The second half is a bit lengthy and should have been edited severely to leave a more solid impact on the viewers.\n\nMusically, the film has only two tracks which score above the rest and as I felt the background music was more enjoyable then the whole soundtrack. Rahat Fateh Ali Khan&apos;s song has now become a must for every good budget movie irrespective of the fact that whether his voice suits on any character in the film or not. But still he somehow manages to score in his most of the tracks, which is remarkable as an artist. Cinematography is one of those rare aces in the movie along with its eye catching costume designing.\n\nCollectively, ANJAANA ANJAANI can only be watched for Priyanka and Ranbir alone as they remain the soul of the film, with their brilliant, realistic performances of the Losers. The first half certainly is more entertaining than the second having the few worth watching moments for the youth. Both Priyanka and Ranbir once again prove their mettle with this movie and confidently declare that they can easily carry off a project on their shoulders alone without the help of any major supporting cast. But in absence of an adequate, strong and emotional script, their performances unfortunately just remain floating on the surface. As a surprise package, Zyed Khan is also there acting seriously in some scenes along with Priyanka.\n\nHowever, the film once again made me think that when the directors choose an inspired subject for their films or when they shoot an exactly similar sequence, secretly taken from another source, then do they inform this truth to their leading stars or they keep them in dark forever?\n\nAnyway, ANJAANA ANJAANI couldn&apos;t impress me a lot as it was not based on an original thought and lacked a fine execution but you may like it if you are a fan of Priyanka and Ranbir."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Drama"",""Musical""]","""2010-10-01""","""bollywood musical,bridge,love,heartbreak,car""","""2H31M""",12.0

The film narrates the tale of four women in a neighborhood in Bhopal. \n\nLeela (Aahana Kumra) wants to run a honeymoon-management venture with photographer (and sexual partner) Arshad (Vikrant Massey) around the same time that she gets engaged to Manoj (the typical groom with 90s Bollywood sensibilities) leaving her in a dilemma on who to choose while going forward in life. Rehana (Plabita Borthakur) gets to portray a character that resembles the film&apos;s title - a college student who loves to wear bold designer dresses, jeans and sneakers (and of course, lipstick) under the dark burkha she dons while leaving/returning her home (her folks are in the tailoring business). Shirin (Konkona Sen Sharma) is a saleswoman by day (which her husband doesn&apos;t know of) and sex-object for her husband by night. Usha Buaji (Ratna Pathak Shah) is in her mid 50s, a matriarch known for her uprightness. She secretly engages in a horny phone- romance with a young swimming coach. \n\nWait, all these characters are actually different shades of &apos;Rosy&apos; - the fictitious heroine of an erotic novel, read by Buaji. Or are they not? While the film raises valid points on freedom of expression (in terms of occupational aspirations, dressing styles, sexual interests or taste in music even) when it comes to womenfolk, it does so at by portraying most of the men characters as vile/rotten/insecure. Is it so hard to make a feminist film without depicting the men as scoundrels (cheating husbands, jealous and instantly-dumping boyfriends, daddies who believe their daughters should be hidden away in boxes)? I think a feminist masterpiece would take shape only when women are portrayed (holistically) on/above par with their strong-willed (and well- written) better halves. That&apos;s when you feel a sense of genuine gratification. &apos;LUMB&apos; ultimately falls well short on this aspect and the climax has the feel of an under-cooked dish (symbolic of one of those &apos;shredded novellas&apos;).\n\nOf all the four characters, I think I&apos;d have to go with Shirin. Konkona induces a tinge of subtlety to her character that the viewer finds easy to empathize with, and also gets some of the best-written scenes in the film (one involving a pest-control gun). While the rest of the performances are solid on their own terms, it is the intrepid rendition of certain (though-of-as) tabooed themes that mostly strike the viewer as refreshingly good. And here&apos;s something I found quite odd. Rehana is both a &apos;Miley Cyrus&apos; and &apos;Led Zeppelin&apos; fan. (It almost feels like she has only listened to that one path- breaking popular song from a band and all of a sudden, started addressing them as her favorite!).\n\nThis isn&apos;t &apos;English Vinglish&apos;, &apos;Queen&apos; or &apos;Parched&apos;. Still, I&apos;d say &apos;LUMB&apos; is worth a viewing for its unabashed take on women&apos;s desires and aspirations (regardless of age), though with its own set of flaws.\n\nVerdict","[""Comedy"",""Drama""]","""2017-07-21""","""sexual relationships,indian sex comedy""","""1H57M""",6.0

Thanks to the changing wave of Indian cinema Aamir Khan gave us the brilliant Taare Zameen Par in 2007 which was the creation of Amol Gupte (He was the creative director of the film). In 2011 Amol Gupte came up with heart warming Stanley Ka Dabba which reflected the potential he had showed with the screenplay of TZP. Stanley Ka Dabba starts with a highly zoomed shot of a warm day with a school kid (that&apos;s Stanley superbly played by Partho) with bruised face, little shabby yet jubilant walking towards the camera. As he enters the school and changes the calendar followed by a sleepy moment of ecstasy within himself reflects the monotonous schedule of a lonely child who is happy with his own supposed peaceful existence. He is the star kid who is good at everything from books to ball without any air of arrogance. His friends and teachers all love him except Khadoos , an appropriate title given by the 4th standard student to their Hindi teacher Verma Sir (played by Amol Gupte). Verma sir is an unapologetic glutton who pounces on others tiffin (dabba) be it the teachers or students. The cold war between Verma and Stanley starts with later not bringing much awaited Dabba for Verma sir to pounce upon. With a beautiful cat-and-mouse game the student gang of Stanley makes Verma run all around the campus everyday till the group is caught red handed. Without revealing the climax it is the emotional journey without getting too filmy that touches the right chord. With Verma realizing his mistake to the oxymoron brutally sweet climax it keeps the viewer engaged and at the end one leaves the hall pondering on certain aspect of Indian society that needs to be taken care for freedom of more Stanleys in real life.\n\nAmol Gupte made a path breaking debut with Stanley Ka Dabba which tells simple uncomplicated story even though it reflects a complicated story about some harsh Indian reality. To tell his story the writer (again Gupte himself) did a commendable job in creating few characters around which the story revolves and took his sweet time in creating each characters. The teachers are sketched out of reality. Rosi Miss (played beautifully by Divya Dutta) is the loving English teacher who is a lady with gentle heart is someone everyone of us again identify. Similarly there is a strict science teacher Mrs Iyer (played by Divya Jagdale) who is not among favorites. Each teacher has been given adequate screen time as needed in the screenplay. Verma Sir (aka Khadoos) is a well edged character and when one expect a filmy flashback on Verma sir&apos;s life the writer keeps it subtle making Verma a symbolic extension of Stanley (and different Stanleys in the society). But then to keep Stanley and Verma in the same plane would be blasphemous. While Stanley is symbolizes Friendship and humanity Verma reflects selfishness within.\n\nThe technical department played a crucial role in defining the mood of the theme with fabulous use of camera(DOP by Amol Gole) that zooms in amateurishly to speak about the restlessness with Stanley&apos;s character or in the scene where Verma Sir looks at the dabba. The scene reflects Dabba being an important character in the narrative. Deepa Bhatia does a commendable job in the editing department and same goes to the sound designer who specially during the rehearsal sequences uses right beats of guitar telling us about the joy inside Stanley. The music is effective by Hitesh Sonik who uses the right instruments for respective moods added to it awesome lyrics by Amol Gupte again to add on to the cream. Specially &quot;apne andar kahin chupa hai ek Stanley&quot; the lyrics speaks some thousand sentences. And the poems in the film are intelligently human that reminded me of the marvelous poem in another masterpiece film Udaan. (like Udaan I sincerely hope Stanley too wins lots of awards in film festivals and awards)\n\nAmol Gupte avoided filmy clichés and forced emotions while writing the story. He didn&apos;t go overboard and in his own lethargic space creates a beautiful world of Stanley and provides a cushion of happiness for the audience. But then suddenly in the flight of happiness he punches hard with a thudding twist that breaks the cushion. Yet the end is optimistic and about hope. The movie didn&apos;t come with a sledgehammer and all to tell audience about some problem instead it just tells a story about a sweet child n his problem n how he moulded his life to live in an innocent and optimistic way. A heart warming tale of friendship and belonging that makes &quot;Stanley Ka Dabba&quot; a must watch.""},""aggregateRating""","[""Comedy"",""Drama"",""Family""]","""2011-05-13""","""teacher,student,lunchbox,working child,curry""","""1H36M""",11.0

Ajay Devgn is a total misfit when it comes to soft mushy romantic and comic roles. Somehow in this movie more than usual, he looked especially old, tired and highly ordinary. He is ideally suited for roles like he plays in &quot;Singham&quot;,but not for roles like this one. If Anil Kapoor had played the part instead of AD and they had left out the songs and had a proper ending the movie would have been a classic comedy.

But looking more further afield, this movie can also apply to other cities in this world that has changed so much since September 11 2001, cities such as New York, London and Madrid, who have faced the same dilemmas. This is what the director Nishkant Kamat has tried to portray.\n\nSoha Ali Khan, has once again excelled like she did in &quot;Khoya Khoya Chand&quot; as the aspiring journalist, Kay Kay Menon, as the young unemployed computer engineer is very convincing in his role as a person who suspects people around him. Finally, Paresh Rawal, as the Policeman who is about to retire is just superb and is able to portray as to how his character feels about what he has achieved during his time in the force.

Tell me any comedy film which has logic and to be watched with brain barring one or two. This is like typical Govinda- David Dhavan comedy films however it will take time for Kapil to create that kind of magical image. Kapil is comfortable in comedy. There are many comical one liners which produce lot of gags. Sometimes dialogue delivery by Kapil feels a bit fast though his forte but needs to be adjusted with the perception of the viewers. The music is foot tapping and slowly catching momentum in public. The film is evenly paced and when it comes to an end we wish it to continue for more time. Kapil is often loud in his comedy show but that loudness is a bit subdued in the film. The drunken scene lamenting plight of three wives just before interval is awesome. The seasoned actors Manoj Joshi, Sharad Saxena and Supriya Pathak are enjoyable. Eli Avram is most effective of all the four of Kapil&apos;s heroines. The acting of characters playing his wives is average but that doesn&apos;t spoil the comedy created from the situations. Kapil has not been able to give variety of expressions that are normally seen in his comedy show.

Faisal is known for his penchant to craft authentic middle-class milieu with his rooted characters under the context of relevant social topics,and this time he examines the stigma of dowry practices which has maligned the institution of marriage, but in a lighter vein.\n\nDisillusioned with love and tired of matrimonial encounters with over-demanding prospective bridegrooms, Gulrez aka Gullu (Parineeti Chopra),an shoe-sales girl, hatches a con-plan to avenge her humiliations by duping them into fake marriage and imposing charges under section 498A of anti-dowry act. In that way, she can also get hefty sum of money to fulfill her long-nurtured &apos;American&apos; dreams. She cajoles her resistant father, Bujji(Anupam Kher) an ordinary high court clerk who succumbs to her emotional blackmail. This leads them to Lucknow, where they stumble upon one of their &apos;bakras&apos;,Tariq Hyderi aka Taru(Aditya Roy Kapur) who happens to be an extraordinary cook. Taru is bowled by the feisty girl&apos;s charms ,and while Gullu gets gradually swooned by the aroma emanating from the Biryanis and Kababs of Taru&apos;s kitchen, their plan is thrashed sweetly by the blossoming love.\n\nIt&apos;s a richly textured premise which offers us an irresistible array of starters , a somewhat delicious main course but the dessert spread turns out to be rather bland.Cutting through the colorful nuances of the city of Nizams, Hyderabad, the narrative also presents a warmth-filled camaraderie between the father and her daughter. The film&apos;s latter half dwells in the revelry of Lucknow and its rich culinary traditions which forms a canvas for the romance between its protagonists. The Blemishes - it suffers from logic issues. The climax looks hurried and doesn&apos;t convince us about Taru&apos;s sudden change of heart for Gullu.\n\nThese lacunae are however washed off by the spirited performances of the film&apos;s central characters. Parineeti Chopra imbues Gullu with full radiance, sparkles and confidence.

He followed the counsel of friends who advised him to make some money before venturing on such an offbeat drama and made such purely commercial, but thoroughly enjoyable, films as &quot;Aar Paar&quot;, &quot;C.I.D&quot; and &quot;Mr &amp; Mrs 55&quot; which were all commercially very successful.\n\n&quot;Pyaasa&quot; starts brilliantly - a man lying down, staring at the sky, the flowers - all very happy. A bee starts buzzing over a flower and then, moves down to the grass. The smile on the poet&apos;s face is broken as a man&apos;s boot uncaringly descends on the bee. Thats more or less the theme of the film. The uncaring attitude of the society where the struggling ones are trampled over mercilessly. Laced through this is the whole romance triangle with one lady dumping her lover for a well-to-do businessman for the sake of money, and a prostitute who loves the poet truly.\n\nThe film is filled with some memorable moments and lots of brilliant shots. My favourite is the sequence where Dutt tries to commit suicide is magnificent - there is no dialogue through that 3 minute sequence. But I think the scene would have been even more remarkable had there been no background music.\n\nV.K.Murthy does an outstanding job with the camera. I compare the Guru Dutt-Murthy combo to the Orson Welles-Greg Tolland combo that created &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. Murthy was even better in &quot;Kaagaz ke phool&quot; - but thats for later. This film is an absolute visual treat.\n\nS.D.Burman does a fair job with the music but it is really Sahir Ludhianvi&apos;s poetry thats the pride of the songs in this film. Stinging sharp, the words slam the devious ways of the world, the mercenary nature of the society. The climax, though a trifle melodramatic, is brilliantly conceived.\n\nAll in all, this is a film thats worth preserving in your DVD collection. This was Guru Dutt&apos;s best film and that is saying a lot ! He is now usually touted as the greatest film director in the commercial world of Hindi films. He demonstrates how a film can be both artistically satisfying as well being throughly entertaining to the masses."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama"",""Musical"",""Romance""]","""1957-02-19""","""one word title,india,indian,asian indian,mother son relationship""","""2H26M""",65.0

On reaching he comes to know that selling the property will make his family homeless in India. Later he is kidnapped by goons thinking ..."",""","""This deliciously smart comedy from writer-director Subhash Kapoor stars Rajat Kapoor as Om Shastri, a desperate NRI from America, who must sell off his ancestral village property so he can save his home in New Jersey from being repossessed by the bank. Within days of arriving in the village, however, he is kidnapped by local crime-pin Bhaisaab (played by the excellent Sanjay Mishra), who dreams of a fat ransom in exchange for the NRI&apos;s release. When Shastri reveals that he&apos;s lost everything in the recent financial meltdown, Bhaisaab&apos;s dreams are crushed. That is until Shastri himself, along with Bhaisaab&apos;s trusted right-hand man Anni (played by Oye Lucky Lucky Oye&apos;s Manu Rishi), comes up with a shrewd new plan that will make both the kidnapper and the victim richer by several lakhs.\n\nConstructed from a terrific script that&apos;s strong on plot and packed with crackling dialogue, &apos;Phas Gaye Re Obama&apos; is consistently engaging. Shastri plots his own &apos;sale&apos; from one wisened gangster to the next unsuspecting crook, in what becomes a chain of hilarious cons. Along the way we&apos;re introduced to a string of quirky, original characters that add colour to this palette.\n\nNeha Dhupia stars as Munni, a dreaded don who despises men, and who&apos;s dubbed herself the female Gabbar Singh. She surrounds herself by an army of tough-looking henchwomen with names like Kareena, Deepika, Madhuri, Rani and Preity, and spends her free time chipping away at male statues. Amole Gupte plays a permanently constipated minister who runs a professionally managed kidnapping-and-extortion company, where you&apos;re provided with a receipt on payment of the ransom, and a one-year guarantee against a repeat abduction.\n\nBut the star of the film is Manu Rishi, who brings just the perfect degree of naïvete to his role of a gangster&apos;s moderately-educated sidekick yearning for a better life. His character, Anni has his heart set on moving to America, and insists he&apos;s got what it takes – he&apos;s watched reruns of Obama&apos;s famous &apos;Yes we can!&apos; speech repeatedly, he&apos;s taking English lessons at a local coaching class, and he hasn&apos;t missed a single one of Sylvester Stallone&apos;s greatest action hits.\n\n&apos;Phas Gaye Re Obama&apos; is unpredictable and surprisingly relevant, even if the film&apos;s title (which seems to squarely blame the US President for the recent global recession) is a bit of a stretch. Cleverly written and sharply cast, it&apos;s a film that delivers hearty laughs. Don&apos;t miss it.

I always appreciated his guts of calling a spade a spade and dealing with his chosen theme without fear or favour. Further, nowhere I found him going astray from his track until I watched Rajneeti last year in which he turned the hard-hitting political drama into a Mahabharat-wrapped revenge saga in the post-interval session of the movie.\n\nIn Aarakshan (reservation), he has gone a few steps ahead in the wrong direction. Before release, it was thought in the cine-circles that he has dealt with this sensitive issue with sensitivity and maturity. Pro-reservationists having a vested interest in the Indian voting politics, had started making a hue and cry under the impression that perhaps it has said anything against the reservation policy of the state. And it&apos;s been banned in some states too which, now I know, is ridiculous because the movie speaks in favour of reservations for backward classes. Instead of presenting a balanced view, Prakash Jha has taken a stand this time, the stand in favour of the caste-based reservations. He had (unsuccessfully) fought the Lok Sabha election a few years back and he might be willing to make any such attempt in future as well. And therefore, he knows very well that no anti-reservationist can win any election in India in the given scenario. So the politician in the disguise of the filmmaker also has not taken any chances in this regard.\n\nI always admired Prakash Jha&apos;s guts to point out a finger at the system. But now I can see the hollowness of his guts. Now I realize that the times have come when you can criticize the shameless cops and the thick-skinned politicians because they have now got habituated to their criticism (and condemnation). However, you can&apos;t dare to speak a single word against the reservations in the state-owned (or state-aided) educational institutions and govt. offices (and PSUs). Since the reservations have become an ever-milkable cow in the hands of the politicians, themselves as well as the beneficiaries of the system have become intolerant enough to behead the people who speak a single word against them or even demand a healthy debate on them. Prakash Jha understood that the reservation issue is a tough nut to crack, hence he chose a softer target to attack - the private coaching institutes.\n\nTo justify the title, the filmmaker has considered a few statements and arguments for and against the reservation system enough. Otherwise, he has focused upon the commercialization of education. Well, that&apos;s also a good subject and a burning issue for the middle-class parents who dream big for their children. But then, what&apos;s the need to make the movie under the title Aarakshan and what&apos;s the need to create some traditional villains in the movie and showing them as anti-reservationists (and even castists) ? By showing the baddies as cursing the reservation system and humiliating the lower caste people, the moviemaker has made his own stand pretty clear. The main protagonist opines in favour of caste-based reservations and terms the social rift created by them as the price is to be paid to correct the social injustice. Well, is it the correct price to be paid and is it the correct way to ensure social justice, he does not delve deep into it. And can one injustice be corrected through another injustice ? \n\nPrakash Jha (and his hero - Amitabh Bachchan) is unable to comprehend that the reservations are being expanded only because they have become a means to catch votes. The social harmony and the national unity has got shattered to pieces due to them but do the pro-reservationists really care ? Politicians are not interested in increasing resources and means, they are only interested in restricting access to them through reservations and strengthening their vote banks consisting of the beneficiary communities.\n\nCommercialization of education is definitely detrimental for the society and Prakash Jha has rightly said at a place that even the among the reserved classes, the real beneficiaries will be those only who have money to buy education. However he has presented a too simplistic picture of it and offered a too simplistic remedy for it. This is a traditional hero versus villain clash and the larger-than-life angry young (now old) man comes triumphant in an utterly filmy manner. Not really expected of Prakash Jha.\n\nThe main characters (except the baddies) seem to be real but their activities do not seem to be realistic. Other than Saans Albeli (sung by classical singer - Pandit Chhannulal Mishra), the music is just passable. However, let me admit that the cast has invested hard and sincere work in performance and despite some characters being caricature-like (especially the character of Manoj Bajpai), the cast has done pretty well. \n\nI still recommend this movie because it&apos;s impressive in patches and it&apos;s an entertaining movie which keeps you glued to the screen like a regular masala flick. Let me tell one thing to Prakash Jha loud and clear - the performance of a race-horse is to be compared with that of a race-horse only. It cannot be given any concession for the fact that it is running faster than the Tonga-pulling horse or the horse used in Baaraats (marriage-processions). Prakash Jha&apos;s work is to be evaluated against the high-standards set by him for himself only and those standards cannot be relaxed for any film of him. If he delivers a movie which does not live up to his set standards, he should be ready for brickbats.""},""aggregateRating""","[""Drama"",""Thriller""]","""2011-08-12""","""principal,india,caste,reservation,funeral pyre""","""2H44M""",11.0

The writer attempted a new style, but fell flat. The performances, the characterization was a huge drawback. Kareena&apos;s role was completely wasted. Her acting also was okay. Rani was good, but not great. Hrithik is a good actor, and tried his best, but the because of the disaster screenplay, and poor direction, Hrithik could not bring out his true potential. But he was still good. The length is also very long, I must say I watched this film twice and both times, I almost died from boredom. This film was was a flop at the box office. I see a lot of people praising this film. And I see nobody praising good films of Hrithik&apos;s like Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne lage and Na tum jano na hum, which were released the same year as Mujhse Dosti Karoge but also flopped. Those films were amazing, and Mujhse Dosti karoge is trash compared to those films.

The kiddish delight of the 58 year old Omprakash Verma&apos;s (Paresh Rawal) Gandhism as Nina&apos;s father was the ultimate dessert to the main course romance.

However, little is known to them that both families are bankrupt.\n\nExpectations are sky-high as the film is directed by Vikas Bahl who previously made the National Award winning film Queen. With big names like Anurag Kashyap and Karan Johar backing the film, it was supposed to be better than Queen. However, after watching the film you will be disappointed big time. The movie begins with impressive animation telling the story in flashback coupled with subsequent introduction of each characters. If the first half is hilarious, fun and has moments to be remembered, second half is thoroughly disappointing. Even though Bahl had wonderful story to tell, but the lethargic pace and superficial drama could not salvage the film from falling into the pit. The good news is that there are few engaging moments like the wonderful chemistry between Alia Bhatt and Shahid Kapoor, the interaction between Shahid Kapoor and Pankaj Kapur, the visual appeal of the film and the stunning CGI makes it somewhat watchable. Music by Amit Trivedi is good but not excellent. Editing is extremely poor. Why the heck of putting in scenes of Karan Johar&apos;s interview, Qawwalli song and the sky- diving which causes hindrance to the movement of the film. Cinematography is astounding capturing the exotic locations of UK. Choreography is electrifying especially in the &quot;Gulabo&quot; and &quot;Shaandaar&quot; songs.\n\nPerformance is the only silver-lining in this messy drama. Shahid Kapoor and Alia Bhatt carries the film on their shoulder. The unusual pairing will be loved and liked by all. Shahid Kapoor does well in entertaining you and Alia Bhatt looks charming and adorable. She is just getting better in expressions with each film. Pankaj Kapur is brilliant. His scenes with Shahid will definitely bring down the house. Sanah Kapoor does a good job as a first timer.\n\nSo , overall , a golden opportunity gone wasted . Rather than concentrating on technical aspects of the film , Vikas Bahl should have made sincere efforts in the direction and screenplay area. If you are looking for a fairy tale candy-floss romance, Shaandaar might be be a good choice otherwise you can skip it.

His invitees include all his past love interests, each representing a story of either heartbreak or unrequited love, or both, and three main flashbacks presented in three chapters proceed.\n\nMera Naam Joker could be described as slice-of-life cinema, given how real and detailed an account it is of one man&apos;s life, but if taken literally this would be an understatement, because it&apos;s a whole lifetime that is recounted in this picture. I&apos;m not sure why Kapoor chose to make this film so sad in story and execution, and I often wonder if it was the outcome rather than his intention. Mera Naam Joker, of course, like many other films by Kapor, has moments of comedy, many such moments actually, but even beneath all of them, there&apos;s a deeply poignant foundation. Ironically, among the toughest and most heartbreaking scenes take place within the circus and even during a seemingly funny performance on stage. Some of these scenes are so poignant they really are tough to go through.\n\nThe film&apos;s first chapter is one of the most beautiful, sensitive portrayals of teenage life, puberty, and first love ever portrayed on screen. The character of Raju, that clumsy but lovable young adult, who has a heart of gold and a vulnerable soul, is a perfect reflection of the older clown. The way his teenage days are depicted, including his falling in love with his teacher Mary, his sexual fantasies, innocence, feelings of guilt, and romantic realisation, are just extraordinary. Rishi Kapoor is absolutely outstanding in this film, in one of the most natural, amazingly raw and unaffected performances one can imagine by a young man his age. His love interest Simi Garewal is wonderful as his caring teacher, and it&apos;s easy to see how this teenager fell in love with her given both her physical appearance and the cordial warmth she exudes.\n\nThe second chapter, set within a circus where a group of Russian entertainers arrive, is fascinating. First, being a bilingual episode, it is very rare, but the cultural and linguistic contact between the Indian and the Russian group is stupendous. This is where our protagonist meets the beautiful trapezist Marina, and their relationship is so beautifully portrayed and ends on such a touching, heart-wrenching note. Kseniya Ryabinkina is beautiful and radiant and plays really well opposite Kapoor. The third chapter, while clearly not as good as the first two, is also very interesting, but concludes on the most annoying note in relation to the characters&apos; moral stand and Raju&apos;s attitude of accepting injustice and moving on. Padmini, the talented actress who was an extraordinary dancer, is fantastic in her part as the young woman pretending to be a man.\n\nIt would be fair to say Kapoor was the one filmmaker of Hindi cinema who had this incredible ability to exploit the raw sexuality of his heroines, sometimes by doing so little and without ever making them look vulgar or cheap. Few scenes could compare to the moment Simi Garewal steps out of the river she fell into and the right tip of her dress reveals her leg, the proceeding scene where she is seen undressing in the bushes, or her nude shot in young Raju&apos;s fantasies, which is shot brilliantly. The same can be said about the aesthetic brilliance with which Kseniya Ryabinkina is shot, and the moment Padmini reveals her identity as a woman and wears her sari is a scene of extraordinary artistic merit. The women in this film by Kapoor are the epitome of feminine beauty, each in her own way, and much of how well their beauty was captured is to Kapoor&apos;s credit.\n\nUnder his own extraordinary direction, Raj Kapoor, the actor, shines through. He employs most of his regular gestures and mannerisms, his well-known flamboyance and innocence, but just like with his circus persona, what lies beneath the surface of this amusingly eccentric man is a truly authentic, heartbreaking and compassionate performance of a man who spent his life wanting to make others laugh and never quite got his due. Other than Rishi Kapoor and the extraordinary leading ladies, Rajendra Kumar is there, Dharmendra and Dara Singh make nice appearances, although the best are Achala Sachdev as Raju&apos;s mother who fears most that her son would be a clown like his father, and particularly Manoj Kumar, the teacher&apos;s cool fiancé who immediately recognises Raju&apos;s feelings for his wife and accepts it with full understanding.\n\nThe film&apos;s narrative style and high production values are never less than excellent. The cinematography is excellent, and the background score keeps tugging at the heartstrings as it enhances the situations and gives life to an otherwise difficult story. The music by Shakar-Jaikishen is a classic of Indian cinema. &quot;Ae Bhai Zara Dekh Ke Chalo&quot;, &quot;Kehta Hai Joker Sara Zamana&quot;, &quot;Ang Lag Jaa Balma&quot;, are all melodious, beautiful numbers brilliantly and soulfully sung by Manna Dey, Mukesh, and Asha Bhosle, respectively. The film&apos;s trademark number, of course, is Mukesh&apos;s poignant rendition of &quot;Jeena Yahan Marna Yahan&quot;. This song pretty much sums up what Mera Naam Joker is, the sad story of a funny clown, a difficult film to watch but an ultimately rewarding experience. This film is a true example of the craftsmanship of Raj Kapoor, a true showman of Indian cinema who reinforced time and again the high quality present in mainstream films."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Drama""]","""1970-12-18""","""mother son relationship,single mother,teenager,teenage boy,naivety""","""3H44M""",52.0

Since, from the posters and promo, it does not really tell a person what the movie is really about. It just says Mere Dad Ki Maruti. (My dad&apos;s Maruti car). You don&apos;t get an idea about what the movie is going to be about. Similarly, when I had seen the poster, I wasn&apos;t really moved by it, to go see the film. I went because of Ram Kapoor. He is a talented veteran actor and one of my favourites.\n\nI wanted to watch Jolly LLB instead of MDKM, but went for it. I am so glad I did. Every penny&apos;s worth, this movie. I might have liked it even more, because I am a Punjabi and I could relate to the whole film so much. Loved the wedding background to the film&apos;s story, loved the cast, loved the acting, loved the dialogues. I am so glad, it was a CLEAN, FUN, FAMILY ENTERTAINER. We do need those once in a while to watch. Liked that there wasn&apos;t any kisses or anything, or cheap dialogues, unlike other comedy films that come out which rely on cheap slapstick humour to do well and gain audience&apos;s attention.\n\nIt was light-hearted fun and boy did it entertain. I won&apos;t hesitate to go again and watch it. I even suggested this film to everyone I know. It is a must watch, at least once. If you are a Punjabi, you just have to watch it. The whole cinema was laughing and through out the film, people were laughing. The film talks about how youngsters make mistakes and how to get over that mistake, we grow up in the process. It is a good comedy with a message attached. Do not expect too much from this film, but it will entertain you.\n\nThe best part about the film, is the soundtrack. THIS IS ONE FILM WHICH HAS AMAZING SONGS. All of the songs in the film rock. From Haay, Mai Senti Hoon, to Hip Hip Huraah (the really catchy item song) - to even the title track. It is a rocking soundtrack, which is deffo car playable material."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Drama"",""Romance""]","""2013-03-15""","""f rated""","""1H41M""",9.0

She is partially liberated by Vikram Mallah (Nirmal Pandey), one of the bandits she is taken in by and eventually rises to lead the group, extracting vicious revenge on upper-cast men in repayment for what they had done to her.\n\nThe film is a fascinating account of the life of Phoolan Devi who was assassinated in September 2001. The film follows from rise (if you can call it that) from abused child to Bandit Queen. Scenes of abuse are tactfully portrayed with the focus on Phoolan&apos;s face rather than the act itself. This focus allows the viewer to see the pain that is inflicted by the abuse. This is still very hard to sit and watch be it the abuse by her husband at 11 or the gang rape of adulthood. It&apos;s sad that worldwide women are treated as second-class citizens, often subject to this type of terrible abuse as a matter of daily life - even sadder that many religions are interpreted to allow it.\n\nWhere the film is weak is the depiction of the two sets of violence - violence against Phoolan is shown as horrible and unforgivable as it should be, however her acts of retaliation are filmed with a more artistic camera and you get the feeling that we are meant to take it that these acts of violence are less horrible because they are revenge attacks. Many of those killed by Phoolan&apos;s gang had not done anything to her and were &quot;innocent&quot;. The film should have a more even tone across all these actions.\n\nThe performances are roundly excellent. All characters no matter how repugnant or noble are played as totally believable - for many you see both sides of their characters. Seema Biswas is excellent as Phoolan Devi, she convinces throughout the film. The subject matter must have been very difficult to act through but she is without a flaw in the lead - the only problem being the slightly sympathetic edge towards her acts of revenge that the film gives.\n\nThe film is horrible viewing and yet inspiring that one woman could survive through such events in such a society. Phoolan lived with things that the vast majority of us will ever imagine, she rose up against amazing odds to marry above her caste and be elected to the Indian Parliament. Worth watching to help you be aware of the rest of the world and to ensure that you keep yourself kind towards others in all situations.\n\nLong live Phoolan Devi. May she find more peace in death than she did in life.""},""aggregateRating""","[""Biography"",""Crime"",""Drama""]","""1995-01-28""","""nudity,female nudity,rape and revenge,public nudity,f rated""","""1H59M""",28.0

Salman is at its best, and tries hard to make us laugh, even impressive in emotional role too. Asin was okay as an confused girl who didn&apos;t decide she loves Salman or not. Aditya Roy Kapur and Ranvijay are good in supporting role. Ajay Devgan was not upto mark, as he plays the negative role in the movie, but he was clearly unpresentable in the role of a Jealous Musician and silent lover. Though he does an excellent work in Deewangee as an silent lover and musician, but here he spoils the movie. Music was also bad expect 1-2 track. I will give 6/10 to this movie. Salman is the only saving grace of the movie."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama"",""Music""]","""2009-10-30""","""friend,childhood,wembley stadium,childhood friend,whipping""","""2H26M""",13.0

Boy meets girl in college, here it is the turn of boy to reject girl&apos;s feelings, and then ultimately coming to terms. So what is new here?\n\nThe movie has the feeling of &quot;deja vu&quot; in its entire run. In 60s, Shammi Kapoor (and his clones) tried to woo Asha Parekh on tunes of OP Naiyyar, in 70s it was turn of Rishi Kapoor to gyrate on Pancham&apos;s tunes, in 90s, it was turn of Aamir Khan / Akshay Kumar and Madhuri Dixit (and others) to romance on tunes of Anand Milind/Nadeem Shravan / Jatin Lalit. And now, in 2004, you have Shahid Kapoor\n\nThe most irritating part is the never changing psychological profile of girls in the movie. Even in the year of 2004, they are as &quot;pativrata&quot; as their black and white counter parts (Meena Kumari in white saari singing a Bhajan in front of Lord Krishna). The girls are foolish enough to fall in love, when the guys fake their feelings towards them, just to get some favour. It feels they haven&apos;t learnt anything from their mothers and grand mothers. Falling in love is so easy for them.\n\nAnd for gods sake, a 19 year old performing a &quot;karva chauth&quot; for his husband-to-be!!!!!!!!!!!. Gimme a break. The Indian directors do not seem to be free of DDLJ hangover. And please, Karva Chauth is only a North Indian tradition. When will our producers learn, that there is a whole India out there who is culturally very different from Northern India.\n\nWomen&apos;s liberation movement or political correctness is almost unheard of in Bollywood. Just showing heroine wearing skimpy ultramodern clothes, and gyrating in discos does not make them independent. It is the thoughts that count. But hell, who cares ???\n\nAnd the teenagers in the movie always are wealthy sons of their wealthy parents. They study in south Bombay college, drive cars, wear expensive clothes, live in palace-like homes where they have their own separate bedrooms, eat burger-coke-fries, go to discos.\n\nAnd what is the deal with the hero Rajeev? Isn&apos;t he mature enough to analyze his own feelings? Why he suddenly abandons the other girls without proper reason? Just because the first girl loves him does not mean that he will find true love only from her. What about the other girl&apos;s feelings?\n\nThe story writers even cannot think new name for the characters. The hero is &quot;Rajeev&quot;, heroine is &quot;Payal&quot;. Even before 20 years, we had the same name. The characters are of new generation, but can&apos;t have new names.\n\nBut hey, who cares.

Well,its a pure cliché, which is churned into a cauldron of romance, ample naach-gaana,daru-shaaru and action.A lot of energy is infused by the flamboyant Ranveer who proves his mettle at comedy yet again with terrific one-liners.He is ably armed with the perky and piquant Parineeti who is effortless as far as the acting chops go , but crippled with outrageous styling and ill-sketched characterization.A series of SMS exchanges between the duo provides genuine &apos;LOL&apos; moments.Equally noteworthy is the job interview sequence which lands Ranveer up in desperation to crack.Ali Zafar provides the balancing act here with his self-restrain while Govinda makes a praise-worthy comeback in a negative role.In fact, with the catchy soundtracks ( Shankar-Ehsaan- Loy)and the veteran&apos;s signature steps, it does manage to keep you in the groove.\n\nIn spite of all these positives, Kill Dill is muddled with a hackneyed script and over-simplistic treatment which doesn&apos;t give any depth to the characters and you know you are tricked only when it ends abruptly , after running a little more than two hours.If you want to know my verdict, I would label it as another Yashraj flick with an infamous &apos;style over substance&apos; tag.\n\nRating ","[""Action"",""Comedy"",""Drama""]","""2014-11-14""","""friendship between men,hitman,mentor,orphan,swimming pool""","""2H7M""",8.0

Manu was from a village in the backwoods. Neeru was the girl next door, his lost love."",""","""Ghosh brilliantly tells the simple story of two former lovers reunited by a rainy circumstance. He doesn&apos;t waste our time and money nor his money on useless subplots, unnecessary outdoor locations or irrelevant props. Through a simple story, he makes one think of complicated issues and circumstances that bring us together or drive us away from one another.\n\n&apos;Raincoat&apos; can also be seen as a character study. Manoj and Nirja&apos;s characters are very well written. As we compare both the characters in flashback and present time, we see that Manoj hasn&apos;t changed much in the years while Nirja hides her guilt but at the same time longs for Manoj. Nirja&apos;s the one who&apos;s changed. The two characters try their best to mask their present dilemmas by pretending to be happy with their respective lives but they just know one another too well and eventually discover the truth. Rain too plays an important role. It is a rainy day that brings the two lost people together yet it also plays a symbolic role that echos Nirja and Manoj&apos;s secret.\n\nA film like this requires great acting and sadly neither Ajay nor Aishwarya are up to this mark. Ajay Devgan tries to deliver a sincere performance (but he doesn&apos;t seem to get into the character unlike in his best works e.g. &apos;Zakhm&apos; and &apos;Company&apos;). Aishwarya Rai delivers her finest work to date but like Devgan she too seems to have some difficulty playing her character and she doesn&apos;t quite get the Bengali Bao as Tabu did in &apos;The Namesake&apos; or Rani did in &apos;Hey Ram&apos;. Yet, she seems to do her best and one should appreciate that effort. However, it is Annu Kapoor as the sneaky landlord who steals the show and somewhat makes up for the shortcomings. In a brief role, he is a knockout. Supporting performances are fine especially especially the actress who plays the friend&apos;s wife.\n\nShobha Mudgal&apos;s mesmerizingly mysterious voice adds more to the quality of the mood and sound effect is very... effective. All in all, this is Ghosh&apos;s piece and he deserves most credit for putting O. Henry&apos;s work so delicately but brightly on screen. It is the writing that makes the characters rich and interesting. Definitely a rainy day flick, but one that may not appeal to all.""},""aggregateRating""","[""Drama"",""Romance""]","""2004-12-24""","""raincoat,money,one word title,lie,flashback""","""1H57M""",18.0

Even years after these incidents, images of the past haunts him as he lives in dilemma about the existence of such occult forces.\n\nDebutant director Kannan Iyer got ample support from producer Vishal Bhardwaj as was evident from the dark frames used,which are trademark of Vishal.The film opens with shadowy blue &amp; black frames with Rekha Bhardwaj rendering her voice to the infesting, creepy &quot;Lautungi Mein&quot; which sets the mood of the film.Bhardwaj&apos;s screenplay is taut &amp; we are straight away introduced to Bobo&apos;s problems in life.With Bobo being hypnotized back to his childhood the audience is in for some creepy ride.With sharp editing by veteran ShreekarPrasad &amp; tilted camera angles by SaurabhGoswami (few long shot to substantiate the lonely creepy feel) did the trick.ClintonCerejo&apos;s background score set the atmosphere perfectly.Kudos to Iyer for the extra effort he invested in setting each &amp; every props at Bobo&apos;s place and psychiatrist Dr RanjanPalit&apos;s chamber. It is one of the rare Hindi films that doesn&apos;t use any gimmicks to scare but resorts to characterization &amp; atmosphere to bring out the spooky element which lingers long after the film gets over.The film keeps a realistic feel even within its surreal limitations.The dialogs add in to the proceedings with age-old myths seamlessly getting merged into urban existence. Bhardwaj-Gulzar combo again succeeds in bringing a winning track which complements the narrative.&quot;Lautungi Mein&quot; reminds the yesteryears songs from Mahal,Gumnam &amp; with semi-classical tone evokes a earthy horror feeling.&quot;Yaaram&quot; is a brilliant composition &amp; these proceedings following the song sequence accelerates the speed towards the somewhat bizarre climax.\n\nTill the climax I was mumbling to myself that ETD is indeed a classic but then cliché final confrontation reminded me of those run-of-the-mills Vikram Bhatt films which made me ponder what would have forced Kannan Iyer to cater to the gallery at the penultimate sequence.The good-versus-evil finale looked misfit in otherwise smart film.Also the big twist at the end could have been foreseen in the first half itself.\n\nIyer had the opportunity to work with the finest talents in Bollywood &amp; it paid-off successfully.The actresses in the film had made a striking impression especially Konkona(Diana).The role offered her was something which is diametrically opposite to what she had been doing till now &amp; she did complete justice to it.The role will be long talked about in years to come.Huma Qureshi showed her potential with GOW, LSTCK and she continues to impress in this film too.With perfect blend of good looks &amp; talents she will be the one to watch out for in near future.Kalki Koechlin is always dependent &amp; there is no aberration here.Being introduced post-interval her character breaks the monotony of the narrative &amp; brought in fresh angles to the quest to find the &apos;original&apos; witch.It is heartening to see talented veteran actor Pawan Malhotra, in a meaty role of Emraan&apos;s geeky professor father.He exudes the right emotions making the character expressive.Rajatava Datta(a fine actor &amp; a big name in Bengali cinema)excels as Dr Palit,the psychiatrist,who is suppose to act most rational,seems confused about his believes in myths of witches &amp; is as eager to learn the truth.Visshesh Tiwari is marvelous as young Bobo.His histrionics were flawless-an excellent actor in the making.The child actress who played bebo&apos;s sister had the charm and innocence to hook the audience to the screen. .And the leading man Emraan Hashmi who has been criticized by critics for his choice of roles till he bounced back with &quot;Dirty Picture&quot;,&apos;Shanghai&quot;,&quot;Ek th daayan&quot; (&amp; now upcoming &quot;Ghanchakkar&quot;).In each of the films he explored varied characters &amp; wooed us with his acting abilities.As psychologically disturbed Bobo with a haunting puzzling past Emraan grasped the nuances of the character &amp; delivered a top-notch performance.\n\nETD is a great attempt in Hindi celluloid albeit a mediocre climax.The entire team should be applauded for the effort to concatenate ancient myths with modern existence &amp; deliver a hardcore entertaining creepy horror film.Good to see concepts like folklore,zombies are explored thus giving us break from the bland taste of formula based Hindi movies.\n\nP.S","[""Horror"",""Romance"",""Thriller""]","""2013-04-18""","""witch,witchcraft,psychotherapist,boyfriend girlfriend relationship,hospital""","""2H15M""",9.0

It will be a nightmare, if they fail to do so. But more or less, it&apos;s an alliance filled of compromises and lies at times. Lies can be said to keep the spouse happy too. But at what cost, is a terrible question. The consequences are mostly dreadful at times even practically. This movie is about an alliance of Love and Lies. \n\nFarhan Akhtar is man with tons of talent and his acting talent and his coming come use in a great deal in this film. Vidya Balan has been one of the finest actress in recent years and she plays her role as a wife and mother wonderfully. Between the two, their chemistry is great, and they seem to slide well into their roles. \n\nAa script about a typical after marriage life, having baby, and trying to run away from responsibilities, learning from mistakes and forgiving each other would have been nonsensical if it did not have some great dialogs, which should make the stereotypes as fun but not as caricatures. that&apos;s what precisely happened in this well written script by Saket Chaudhary. \n\nFrom being together and have fun in early years of marriage, to changing anatomy through pregnancy, while the man becomes more responsible towards the family, and even earns more for them. This is all a clichéd tale that every family goes through. The parent teacher meetings, the birthday parties of the kid&apos;s friends, they are all part and parcel of life. Now, those are made interesting by some good writing and fine acting. \n\nTogether, the team has done a wonderful job in taking the script to a respectable level. The execution through cinematography is wonderful too. Though, editing seems to have disappointed in second half by dragging on some very dramatic moments, which would have been better chopped off. \n\nTo Farhan and Vidya alone, this film is worth. Also there are wonderful performances by others including Vir Das and Ram Kapoor among many others.\n\nA 3/5 would be apt in a film that&apos;s hilarious right through the first half, and a kind of drama in the second half.

Now the much ballyhood actor of recent times- Hrithik Roshan, This guy is so chisseled and handsome that he almost looks like a funny looking kid. Can he act? yes,sometimes; but it is almost painful to watch him. With a V-shaped body, a biceps as big as the state of Montana,and a good disposition towards the opposite sex he will make a good Indian Bond, if only some producer could catch on to this. The problem with the so called &quot;stars&quot; of the 80&apos; generation is that they count on the looks so much they forget they are actors first. If you watched the Movie Monsoon Wedding there is this charecter &quot;P.k.

The looks draw the audience initially but to sustain thereon you need a talent like Anil Kapoor or Amitab Bachchan. Sorry Kiddo you are not going to cut it. I loved the music including the prayer song, the duet, and the very aesthetic and sexy number by Sushmita Sen so much so she made it to the cover of a Hollywood Film Magazine. Some of the best &quot;Bollywood&quot; dances in the recent years were in &quot;Om Jai Jagdish&quot; and &quot;Humraaz&quot;.

Now since the plot had nothing new to offer to either the distributors or the viewers so the makers think of the same tried and tested sex formula which recently was accepted well in the huge hit THE DIRTY PICTURE. In fact, it seems that the present HATE STORY is a kind of after-effect of TDP in which the makers solely use the sex angle and few erotic scenes to bring in a particular section of audience, mainly in the single screen theaters and the smaller centers. \n\nLuckily the film makes a good impression in its first half and the story progression keeps the viewer hooked as he keeps on expecting something shocking to come any moment (as shown in its promos). But all the expectations raised by its initial hour get shattered by a very vaguely directed second half which has everything over the top accompanied by some bad acting and illogical plots. Actually post intermission the director seems to have kept the craft apart and becomes only interested in adding all the steamy scenes and fiery dialogues for the viewers who have especially visited the theater for the very purpose. And that&apos;s where the film gets ruined completely. With a weird kind of writing wherein a famous prostitute gets easily appointed as the board of director of a reputed bank with the interference of an influential Minister, HATE STORY wastes the entire fine build-up made by its first half.\n\nLeading the vengeance saga, Paoli coming from Bengali films, makes the most controversial and unconventional debut ever in Hindi films. She is confident to take off every bit of cloth from her body to catch the attention of both the viewers as well as the industry. But other than the skin show she doesn&apos;t expose any exceptional talent of hers on the screen. So the present debut can only get her some similar roles and she will have to show the other part of her art in the next film. However she reasonably does well in the first half as the other actors in the cast. But post intermission mediocre acting takes over the film completely and no one is able to make any kind of impact till its strange climax. Interestingly the culmination also reminded me of a similar one, earlier seen in JOHNY GADDAR.\n\nGulshan as the main villain, does well in the first hour but again gives away to a loud act later on. Nikhil the only hopeful and honest character in the film is decent but gets very less mileage in comparison to the rest. Mohan Kapoor is perfect, Bhairavi is hardly there and Iravati is a talent wasted badly. So, Suresh Dubey as the strict industrialist cum father is the one actor who makes his presence felt with his acting.\n\nMusically, it has a below average soundtrack with one good (sad) song, which sounds fine while watching the film. Background score keeps moving between decent and loud, whereas its Cinematographer cans all the erotic scenes brightly in an attempt to show it all. In addition the dialogue writer tries everything to make it look (or sound) like a soft-porn with lines such as &quot;Take It, Shake It &amp; Fake It&quot;.\n\nBut here I would like to share, what in my opinion must have been the &apos;Base Thought&apos; behind making HATE STORY.\n\nAfter knowing about the title, subject &amp; favourable reports of THE DIRTY PICTURE in production in the late 2011, the producer or director must have imagined the great potential it had as a project. So taking a clue from it he must have thought of just one line to visualise this film. \n\nAnd that one line has to be, &quot;Get me a good looking sexy girl who is ready to take off all her clothes on the screen and can sign that clear clause written in the contract about nudity or skin-show&quot;.\n\n&quot;But what about the story or screenplay?&quot;, someone must have questioned. To this the reply must have been &quot;That we can easily write later on as the film will solely run on its seducing erotic scenes and revealing promos.&quot; \n\nThat is how the idea of HATE STORY must have born in the minds of its producer/director as it hugely relies just on the hype created by all its objectionable promos which even have more sexual content than the movie itself. Obviously the censor used their scissors on certain scenes (like the one with the minister). But even before the promos were banned for the TV, they had already gone viral on the net and had given enough publicity to the film reaching its target audience. \n\nAnother point which proves this fact lies in its questionable script in which a girl who is a trained investigative journalist gets trapped and then sexually traumatised by a rich industrialist. Now this talented educated girl with a good family background, strikes back to take her revenge. But in a hugely absurd manner instead of ruining the guy by working against his whole empire as a hungry detective cum journalist (the job she could have easily gone back to), the silly girl decides to become the most sought after prostitute of the city selling her body to every big shot of the town. \n\nHence is not exactly Cinema but &apos;A Perfect Product Marketing Plan&apos; executed well in the business of selling movies. And since films are more or less made for earning money, so we have to accept it as a part and parcel of the trade. A part, which sadly remains the most talked about and the shady one."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama"",""Thriller""]","""2012-04-20""","""sex scene,erotic thriller,scorned woman,arrest,jilted woman""","""2H20M""",10.0

This one is an erotic tale (will not leave you high and dry, no matter even if your &apos;hunger&apos; is sated on the grandiose stage). Its sexually charging A-rated flick and hence we&apos;ll be digging into this with the same mood in the review.\n\nB.A Pass has its moments of the harsh truth and reality that&apos;s still subliminal in India&apos;s &apos;culture&apos; and ethically followed under the four walls of a closed room. Though in order to tackle a personal pseudo- fiction or psyche-trauma and similarly revealing the social scale &apos;dhanda&apos; (business) of prostitution, it made too much altogether to cover up in the runtime of 95 minutes. The &apos;camel of the desert&apos; (director) tried to do justice to everything he wanted to show or unravel but then it was so much so, that despite of the débutant director&apos;s honest and struggling effort..things were left untold, mummed, and eloquent (negatively) due to its not at all good editing, lacking story and the runtime it had. The messages that the director or writer wanted to showcase were outstanding and deserve a flawless 10/10 but the movie is not judged upon the ideas, it depends on the execution of those ideas on paper and then on the screen..and that&apos;s where it lacks partially. \n\nIts based on a short story &apos;Railway Aunty&apos; and has been adopted nicely by Ritesh Shah (story and screenplay) but lacks to transform it into a larger picture. The film tells about how easy it is to get laid in New Delhi (kidding..a Lil&apos; bit)..it tells about the vicious circle of eroticism and prostitution that&apos;s easy to get into because of its luring attractions and ease of income but hard to get out due to its worse than a nightmare consequences. (remember the piece of cheese in the rat-trap?!). It explains the need of the money and utilitarian approach of attaining the most of it by a consumerist society, deals with morality, emotions and the true colors of life in a realistic fashion. It also reveals the truth about the ongoing and prosperous rackets in even the urban (highly accessible law &amp; order) cities of the &apos;modern&apos; India (pun intended). Then it even deals with the sexual frustrations after marriage, helpless individuals seeking &apos;social services&apos; in form of prostitutes or gigolos, how the innocent lives are ruined due to this NEVER GONNA END vulgarity, and also it traps that how your life reacts onto the choices that you make.\n\nDirection is good and honest. Screenplay and story should have been worked upon. Editing disappointed me due to its lack of power to let the viewers shove their heads in the theme of the movie or to feel its continuity. The cinematography was brilliant and justified the script with its dark look. The camera work was nice and again justifying and locations were raw (as required). There is no song in the movie (I think) but the theme during the climax is haunting and gets you going along with the situation. The performances are great and the lady (Shilpa Shukla) deserves a standing ovation for her magnificent portrayal and marvelous acting, the way she carried her role..with so much ease, it made me a fan of her work, and well not to forget her physique in the movie. She looked smoking hot all the while with her colorful bras, dark lipstick and natural yet flamboyant moaning.\n\nI&apos;d rate this lot to be told but less delivered cult erotica as 7.5/10."",""reviewRating""","[""Crime"",""Drama"",""Thriller""]","""2013-08-02""","""playing chess,older woman seduces younger man,cheating wife,gay rape,new delhi india""","""1H35M""",10.0

No doubt the subject of the film remains one of the favourites of the award giving authorities which happens to be child labour, child education and class divide in India, exploiting the colorful key features of Rajasthan and its people.\n\nBut overall I found the film, too simple and sweet with an evenly paced narration and nothing exceptional. It starts off with a poor mother leaving his 10 years old son at a road side dhaba to work in order to help her financially. The dhaba is owned by a kind hearted person and has also another young man working as a helper who is a big fan of Amitabh Bachchan. As the story moves forward the kid becomes friends with another boy of his age only who is a local prince belonging to a royal family of Rajasthan. Now this boy working at the Dhaba, likes to be called Kalam, as his wants to be a big person like the former president Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. With the help of his friend, he starts studying taking his school books at the dhaba. Later, due to few misunderstanding, Kalam leaves for Delhi to meet the president and the rest come after, searching for him.\n\nNow if we talk about the merits of the film, the biggest one remains the award winning child artist, Harsh Mayar&apos;s performance who is confident, impressive and sweet all together in the role of Kalam. In fact he is the only one who carries the whole film on his small shoulders like a mature actor and stands tall in front of veteran Gulshan Grover. And both Gulshan and Pitobash Tripathy shine brightly in their underwritten roles too. The other merit of the film is its pace and editing which doesn&apos;t give you any dull moment and the film reaches its end quite effortlessly.\n\nDirector Nila Madhab Panda shows his sparks in his debut venture, especially in the way he gets the job done from the kids involved in the film. Plus he also takes great care that there must not be any slow moment in his movie right till the end and it should not have any un- necessary melodrama becoming preachy for the audience. The film has a fine background score, striking dialogues and has an eye-catching cinematography showcasing Bikaner, camels and its hotel turned castles elegantly. And I strongly feel that its camera capturing Rajasthan in all its sparkling colours must have influenced the western viewers as usual.\n\nHowever I really didn&apos;t like the way the DOP captured the world famous Karni Mata&apos;s Temple of Bikaner, which has thousands of rats moving in the premises of temple freely. If possible do visit the place if you really want to see the unbelievable with your own eyes.\n\nComing to the points which force me to declare its nothing exceptional, the first has to be the overall feel of the movie. As I see it, I AM KALAM keeps floating on the verge of a deep sea and never enters its deepness. The message of the film does not hit you hard about child education or abolishing the class system in the society.\n\nSecondly, I was very disappointed with the under-written character of Gulshan Grover playing Bhaati, the dhaba owner. He is very much interested in teaching the kid how to make Tea, but he is not interested in sending him to the nearby school ever. \n\nThirdly, what was the purpose of the one sided love angle track between the foreigner girl and Gulshan Grover? Undoubtedly this seems to be added only to involve the western audiences with the movie and nothing else since the plot has nothing to do with the main theme of the script. Fourthly, there is very less emphasis given to the reason why the boy wants to become KALAM. \n\nLastly is the most interesting fact which struck me in the last half an hour of the film when Kalam runs away to Delhi in order to meet the honorable President. The plot reminded me of a 1957 Black &amp; White Classic produced by Raj Kapoor and directed by Amar Kumar called AB DILLI DOOR NAHIN. \n\nIt was based around a small kid who after being told about the Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru, becomes confident that only Chacha Nehru can solve the problems of his father and family. So, he decides to go to Delhi to meet the Prime Minister himself with a letter for him explaining all his problems. Here in I AM KALAM too, the boy sets off to Delhi to meet Dr. Kalam with a letter in his hand for the President. I don&apos;t know whether the makers had this classic in mind or not but it does have these acute similarities in its sub plot with the original film. Plus this particular part of the movie also remains its weakest one where everything keeps happening so easily around the key locations of Delhi.\n\nIn the acting department, other than the spirited act by Kalam, Gulshan Grover supports the film with his full heart and Pitobash delivers an enjoyable performance. The second child actor, Husaan Saad playing the royal prince acts well and Beatrice Ordeix takes care of the glamour factor in the movie quite easily.\n\nOverall, it remains a simple and sweet movie made around a relevant subject which in turn forced me to go for AB DILLI DOOR NAHIN once again. But I wasn&apos;t convinced looking at the list of awards it has won in various festivals and am still wondering why it is being given such a high rating by all.""},""aggregateRating""","[""Comedy"",""Drama"",""Family""]","""2011-08-05""","""caste,caste system,india,child labor,delhi""","""1H28M""",12.0

With Amol Palekar&apos;s Paheli (2005) as a solid benchmark, it can be difficult to create an interesting film, as this ambitious project by a debutante director shows.\n\nKanan (Suraj Sharma) is a young man who arrives from Canada and is taken by his parents straight to his would-be-fiancée and high school sweetheart Anu&apos;s (Mehreen Pirzada) house for their engagement and subsequent wedding which is scheduled a week from now. Already mad with the swift turn of events and unsure about the whole marriage thing, Kanan tries to speak his mind, but it all falls in deaf ears. Things move at a faster rate as he is directed by the family pandit (Hindu scholar) to first marry a tree so that he can get rid of his astrological curse. No prize for guessing, but Kanan soon finds out that the tree that he married the previous day contained the ghost of a woman named Shashi (Anushka Sharma) who now believes and takes him to be her lawfully-wedded husband. A shaken Kanan tries to avoid her, but for how long? And how is he going to explain it to Anu, who now thinks that Kanan has changed from a genteel lover-boy to a weed-smoking hipster who plays around with women&apos;s feelings...\n\nIf there is a thing called convenient filmmaking, then this is it. With the setup of a big Indian wedding that reminds me of a yesteryear Malayalam-language film, Anwar Rasheed&apos;s Ustad Hotel (2012), used to introduce the characters, the film makes a promising start. Superstitious families, an over-attached girlfriend, and a mysterious ghost from the previous century - the film has everything a Bollywood film could ask for. And for some time, it even manages to entertain. However, the level of quality and entertainment soon falls when you realize that the humor is forced and the drama unceremonious and inconsequential. Kanan is a 26-year old man and his encounters with Shashi are so childish they are cringe-worthy. Suraj&apos;s portrayal as the helpless guy does not work either, even when he is supported by a talented supporting cast.\n\nThe only positive element that works for the film is that the suspense about Shashi&apos;s past stays strong throughout the film, mostly because it is explored non-linearly and is only dug deeper in the final 30 minutes. The base is quite similar to Palekar&apos;s 2005 SRK-starrer, with the exception of disappointing performances from the lead cast. Suraj sports a single expression throughout the 2 hours of running time - whether it is him flirting with his would-be or being terrorized by Shashi. Anushka does not do much for her character other than lazing around from point A to B looking like she hasn&apos;t a clue. All excuses defending her character should be attributed to bad writing. Pirzada is a cutie, but needs to improve her acting chops if she wants to stay. Diljit Dosanjh is the only main character who gives out an authentic performance, and we cannot thank director Anshai Lal for that. The direction is overall average, with Lal using tried and tested methods to narrate his story and still failing to impress. The fitting and well-crafted background score and few hummable songs further accentuate the film as a one-time watch.\n\nWith laudable CGI for a Bollywood film and the fact that the romance in the film is tied to an important part of Indian pre-Independence history, this second production by Anushka Sharma is a watchable but average affair. Go for it if you have nothing else to do.\n\nBOTTOM LINE","[""Comedy"",""Drama"",""Fantasy""]","""2017-03-24""","""tree""","""2H18M""",5.0

Don&apos;t spend your money on this atrocious piece of art and just use it to take your friends out for coffee, Focus on Hollywood if you like superhero movies. \n\nA message for Bollywood Choreographers.\n\nContinue dancing for films but just stay away from the movie cameras and the Director&apos;s chair."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Adventure"",""Comedy""]","""2016-08-25""","""fantasy superhero,superhero""","""2H31M""",6.0

Interestingly, Teresa Wright didn&apos;t like his directing and found it pedantic, adding, &quot;but I can&apos;t say anything because of Jean.&quot; Jean Simmons is one of my favorite actresses and this story serves her well. After twenty years, the lust is gone from Mary Wilson&apos;s marriage to husband Fred (Forsythe); she drinks, she pops pills, and finally, after a huge spending spree, her husband takes her credit cards and charge accounts away from her. Her favorite thing is watching old movies which have happy endings; strangely, one of her favorites is Casablanca. Casablanca has a noble ending, even a satisfactory ending. But a happy ending? I mean, Bogie ends up with Louis.\n\nFinally, Mary manages to get her hands on some money, and she takes off for the Bahamas, where she is taken in by an old school friend (Shirley Jones), the &quot;other woman&quot; in several relationships who now finds herself involved with Lloyd Bridges, looking pretty darn good, I might add.\n\nThe film seems to be a series of flashbacks and music videos; it is surprising how little dialogue there actually is. Jean Simmons at 40 is radiantly beautiful as usual and she does a great job as Mary. Simmons was a totally underrated actress, squeezed in as she was with the likes of Audrey Hepburn and Elizabeth Taylor. Brooks again has cast Shirley Jones as a bad girl, and again, she&apos;s effective. Teresa Wright plays Mary&apos;s mother, who can&apos;t quite understand her daughter&apos;s quest for happiness. Mary wants the fairytale.\n\nI found this film just okay, at times confusing because of the seamlessness of the flashbacks, and frankly, I got sick of hearing &quot;What are you doing...&quot;, a song a young man once sang to me and informed me that he had written it. Right.\n\nAnything with Simmons is worth seeing, but at times, this one is tough going."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama""]","""1970-05-22""","""self destructiveness,adultery,health club,bar,television set""","""1H57M""",53.0

He follows her to her farm, where her elder brother challenges him to produce more seed on their fields. If he wins, he will be allowed to marry her."",""","""RAMAIYA VASTAVAIYA is a romantic film directed by Prabhu Dheva, starring Girish Taurani, Shruti Hassan &amp; Sonu Sood.\n\nThe film revolves around Ram and Sona. Ram is the son of a billionaire in Australia whereas Sona comes from a small village where her brother, Raghuveer, grows crops. The story is about how both of them fall in love and how Ram tries to convince Raghuveer by growing more crops than him.\n\nWhen the trailer of Ramaiya Vastavaiya came out, I wasn&apos;t quite sure I wanted to see it; due to the fact that it had that clichéd romantic storyline and Girish Taurani&apos;s acting looking extremely unprofessional. But after a while, due to the promos and the grand soundtrack, I decided to give the film a shot only because of Sonu Sood and Prabhu Dheva.\n\nRamaiya Vastavaiya is, in the uttermost truth, a simple romantic film with a bit of mindlessness. Honestly, the plot is quite good upon execution and there does tend to be a few funny scenes only due to the fact that there are some mindless, crazy situations placed in the film. That, and Girish Taurani&apos;s acting. But even though the first half of the film tends to be a bit over-the-top, it settles down to be a normal romantic film in the second half; something we wanted in the beginning. Its like, in the first half, Prabhu Dheva decided to butter us up so that we get comfortable with the characters and then in the second half, he gets down to the real stuff. And honestly, I quite understand that; its a good execution, but then some people who don&apos;t like mindless films may be a bit annoyed.\n\nThe soundtrack is extremely good and it gives the film an even further romantic feel. Songs like &quot;Jeene Laga Hoon&quot;, &quot;Bairiyaa&quot; and &quot;Rang Jo Lagyo&quot; suit the film&apos;s theme, whereas &quot;Hip Hop Pammi&quot; and &quot;Jadoo Ki Jappi&quot; are just dance songs.\n\nAnother topic to comment about is the film&apos;s item song, &quot;Jadoo Ki Jappi&quot;. It was extremely unneeded but maybe Prabhu Dheva didn&apos;t want to keep it too serious, although, I feel the film wouldn&apos;t have made much of a difference without it.\n\nThe acting is quite alright. Its nothing grand, yet its simple. Sonu Sood&apos;s acting was very good, as usual. Shruti Hassan was quite good displaying her emotions from time to time. Girish Taurani&apos;s acting quite okay, I guess? I felt it needed a lot more work on his display of emotions even though his character had more of a joker feel to it. I really don&apos;t know, his acting didn&apos;t really stun me.\n\nIn the end, Ramaiya Vastavaiya is a simple romantic film. Go watch it to pass your time; it isn&apos;t a GRAND film but it does entertain you. Go watch it especially for the second half of the film... You&apos;ll have a great time.""},""aggregateRating""","[""Action"",""Drama"",""Romance""]","""2013-07-19""","""bare chested male,male objectification,muscular man,challenge,farm""","""2H28M""",9.0

If you enjoy movies like Welcome, No Entry, or Singh is Kinng you&apos;ll get a kick out of Mubarakan. Remember that if you decide to watch it. Anees Bazmee who directed all of these films brings a crazy tale of misunderstandings in a mad Punjabi family to life and it&apos;s a, surprisingly, funny ride.\n\nKaran and Charan are twin brothers who grew up with a separate aunt and uncle in London and Punjab respectively and are as different as can be. It&apos;s all fun and games until it&apos;s time to get married\n\nKaran is in love with Sweety. Sweety with Karan. Karan&apos;s mother hates Sweety. Charan is in love with Nafisa. Nafisa is Muslim. Charan&apos;s father doesn&apos;t approve. Karan is setup to marry Binkle. Charan meets her instead. Charan now loves Binkle. Binkle&apos;s family hates Charan. Karan gets engaged to Binkle. Charan gets engaged to Sweety. Nafisa is furious. And then there&apos;s Kartar Mamoo/Chachoo who is aware of the kids&apos; dilemma and tries to help only causing further confusion. Did you think the movie would make sense? Of course it doesn&apos;t but don&apos;t worry because it&apos;s all part of the fun.\n\nThe first fifteen minutes or so of the film are clunky as characters and relationships are established. Push through because the real mazaa starts when Kartar begins scheming and the movie takes off. As mentioned before this is a comedy about misunderstandings and miscommunication. The humor is clean and never crude or offensive which keeps things family friendly. It&apos;s also of the situational variety and often bizarre but this is where Anees Bazmee excels. You&apos;ll laugh but also scratch your head wondering why people can&apos;t have a normal conversation. They can&apos;t. Get over it.\n\nArjun Kapoor does a good job especially as Karan. The body language and facial expressions are well executed. The horror of his last film (Half Girlfriend) is almost forgotten. Almost. Ileana D&apos;Cruz brings a certain charm to Sweety and pairs nicely with Arjun. Athiya Shetty is completely wasted. Neha Sharma, credited as a guest appearance, has more to do and say than Athiya. The supporting players are well cast. Ratna Pathak Shah is a treat to watch, as usual. The real star, however, is Anil Kapoor. His comic timing brings the house down and he excels even when the plot stagnates. Mr. Kapoor&apos;s performance alone is worth the price of a ticket.\n\nIf you know what you&apos;re getting into Mubarakan is a wild and laugh-out-loud funny ride. Don&apos;t overthink it and you won&apos;t be bored. It&apos;s a little long and at least one song could&apos;ve been chopped off but there are enough moments that will bring a smile to your face.

Though the film is fast paced, gets you with adrenaline rush and surprises, by the end the film just doesn&apos;t touch you.

And by this I mean the introduction of the other two main characters (Bobby Deol and Lara Dutta) - this time in person rather than in the imaginary world of AB and PZ.\n\nBobby Deol does a very good job considering that he is offered very little in the way of screen time. He plays both his characters very well, in particular the mummy&apos;s boy. Lara Dutta is amazing and really puts Priety Zinta in the shade with her performance. Despite both BD and LD having peripheral parts in the film - they both, in my eyes, walk away with the honours as the most entertaining pair on screen.\n\nAmitabh Bachchan is wasted and only appears every time they need to break the monotony of the main characters. He also appears in the dance competition to lend his support to a rather over long sequence.\n\nOverall, JBJ offers very little in the way of a storyline. The treatment of the subject is what you expect of Yashraj films. But even they couldn&apos;t dress this weak subject up.

It&apos;s a romantic movie showing a family of seven brothers. When the eldest brother is able to find a bride for himself, he has to do it for his six younger brothers too. Sippy Films used this story to make Hindi movie Satte Pe Satta (playing card no. 7 thrown on the opponent player&apos;s playing card no. 7) starring Amitabh Bachchan in the lead role of the eldest brother. Besides, while writing the script of this Bollywood version of the Hollywood movie, they introduced a look-alike of the eldest brother also so that Amitabh Bachchan who was on the peak of his popularity those days could play a double role in the movie.\n\nThe title of the movie has been kept as such because of the prominence of number 7 in the movie (seven are the brothers and thereby seven brides of them also appear), else the story has nothing to do with any playing card game. It&apos;s an entertaining movie using the theme of the Hollywood movie and adding Bollywoodish formulae viz. look-alike, a conspiracy to usurp property and fight in the climax.\n\nThe seven brothers of this movie are orphans whose names have been kept after the names of the days of a week. Well, it was the easiest way to christen themselves as there are seven days in a week. When someone asks them what they would have done had they been more than seven, they reply that in that condition, they would have christened themselves after the names of the months of a calendar year viz. January, February, March etc. So these seven brothers are named as Ravi (Amitabh Bachchan), Som (Sudhir), Mangal (Shakti Kapoor), Budh (Paintal), Guru (Kanwaljeet Singh), Shukra (Vimal Saahu) and Shani (Sachin). The eldest one, i.e., is somewhat educated and sophisticated whereas the other six are completely uneducated and uncivilized. Ravi rules them and takes work from them like bonded labourers.\n\nThe straight day-to-day life of these brothers has been going on monotonously for years. They live in their house situated in a jungle without shaving or taking a bath or dressing up properly. Quarrels are frequent among them. Only Ravi maintains contact with the outside world and when he&apos;s in the house, he keeps on bossing them. The still water of their combined life is stirred by Ravi&apos;s encounter with Indu (Hema Maalini). After initial difficulty, Ravi is able to win Indu&apos;s heart and marries her. But when Indu comes to his house as his bride, she&apos;s taken aback by the look of her husband&apos;s household and his younger brothers. She decides to civilize them and become their instructor for this purpose. However the sight of Ravi&apos;s happy married life with Indu has created romance in the hearts of the other six brothers too. They find their brides among the friends of Indu. On one side, Ravi sets on the mission of bringing the marital happiness in his brothers&apos; lives, on the other, a criminal conspiracy comes into existence.\n\nIndu&apos;s wheel-chair bound friend Seema (Ranjeeta) is an orphan whose uncle Ranjit (Amjad Khan) is having an eye on her wealth and he wants to kill Seema to usurp that. For this purpose, he hires the services of ex-jailbird Baabu (Amitabh Bachchan in double role). When he comes to know that Baabu is the look-alike of Ravi, he kidnaps Ravi and sends Baabu to his home whereas Seema is spending time with her friend Indu and her marital family. Baabu enters the household impersonating Ravi. The conclusion of the story is anybody&apos;s guess.\n\nWhile the first part of the movie is a lift from Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and full of comic, romantic and emotional moments, the second part is nothing but another Bollywoodish plot of a villain&apos;s evil design to usurp a heroine&apos;s property. Quite naturally, it&apos;s the first one which is more important and serves ample entertainment to the audience. All the same, courtesy Amitabh Bachchan&apos;s comic timing and a scene specially written for this purpose, the second half has also become an entertaining one. Director Raj N. Sippy has handled the script very well and done a decent job.\n\nThe movie features a plethora of male-female actors. Actors like Saarika and Vijayendra Ghaatage are also there in guest appearances. All including Hema Maalini and Ranjeeta have done well. It&apos;s painful to see a highly talented actor like Kanwaljeet Singh doing a side role in this movie. But ultimately the movie belongs to Amitabh Bachchan. He has got maximum screen time in his double role and he has delivered admirable performances in both the roles. Especially as Ravi, his performance is terrific and despite being known as an action hero, he has generated a treasure of laughs for the audience through his performance in that role.\n\nSatte Pe Satta carries immense repeat value and can be seen many times. It was a huge commercial hit when released and can prove its worth even today if re-released. It&apos;s a big treat for not just the fans of Amitabh Bachchan but all the movie buffs."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Comedy"",""Drama""]","""1982-01-22""","""bearded man,barn,mistaken identity,bar fight,apology""","""2H40M""",40.0

This movie cannot be compared with any other indian horror or thriller film. it stands by its own, but some stories were hard to believe and very comical at points. You cannot scare somebody if the story looses its believable factor. Like the first story was alright, it was scary with a twist. So was the School teacher one, it was very good it had a mystery element to it. Vivek oberoi&apos;s and Nana Patekar&apos;s story was scary and funny at the same time. it was well written i was just upset with their story&apos;s length. I thought they would have more of a role in the movie. Other stories were just a joke, The apple one, The cigarrete one and the stupidest of all was the Aftab shivadasani with supernatural powers one. It was hilarious more then it was scary. Scary was the seventh story the real one, with the six friends. At the end the movie had an issue to address that only way to get rid of your fears is to die. The ultimate fear is the death. This point was addressed very nicely. The movie would have been nicer if the stories would have chosen carefully.

It is a novel story about young people in modern India. The story is around a challenge of a boy being challenged by his friend to have sex with three women in a day it is difficult to pin point how but this challenge is able to put across the loss of direction the young people face today. It is one of the subtlest film I have seen on ambitions of youth, of cultural diversity we live, and the anxiety these young kids have away from their parental quarters.\n\nNasiruddin Shah&apos;s son Imaad Shah gives a very understate performance against more vocal character portrayed by Sheyas Talpade. A great delight is to see Smriti Mishra as the colourful prostitute in red light area of Delhi.

On the case is a police officer and two disgruntled grooms."",""","""Dolly Ki Doli had an simple yet interesting premise. A con-woman Dolly (Sonam Kapoor) entraps and marries men only to run away with all valuables of the groom and his family. To setup and arrange these fake marriage she has a whole fake family along with her. Sonu (Rajkummar Rao) a jatt farmer who seems to be truly in love with her becomes one such victim. Then after an item number and couple of more fake marriages later is the turn of Manjot (Varun Sharma). There is very less light shed on why this con gang pull-of so many heists yet live a mediocre life. The characters seemed to have zero motivation towards whatever they were doing. Anyways, not all is well when finally after dozens of fake marriages the police comes to know about the gang and a cop (Pulkit Samrat) decides to take up the case because of a some evident personal reason. After few months thanks to Saif Ali Khan&apos;s cameo character, when the cop and the bride finally meet face-to- face we have all the clichéd melodrama and even more illogicality with the ending than what had already been portrayed. Anyways its always hard to pull of a credible ending for such con comedy premises.\n\nOn the positive side, Dolly Ki Doli is briskly based, it just flies off from the word go. Some times the editing felt too choppy but I will appreciate them for keeping it under 100 minutes. This is the basic thing most Bollywood films fail to get right and have overblown run time with very little substance. Debut director Abhishek Dogra keeps the atmosphere light, not to be taken seriously and even satirical at times until the last act. The script is full of illogical behaviors and plot holes, but if you can ignore that then the comedy might be enjoyable. But I myself did not find it hilarious. The comic timing was terrible plus the characters were interesting yet poorly written. Acting wise, all three males Rajkummar,Varun and Pulkit do a commendable job. Sonam Kapoor on the other hand was quite unbearable. Her acting was okayish, but it was the character of Dolly which was utter nonsense. The same old innocent-pretty girl is terribly overdone which made her look annoying plus it is highly unbelievable that so many men fell into her trap so easily. Also we annoying songs and an item number stuffed in just for the sake of it, which had nothing new. \n\nOverall, I will say Dolly Ki Doli is a nice and non-formulaic attempt which is appreciable. But it is heavily flawed and has poor dialogues. This ride can be moderately enjoyable only if don&apos;t care much about the characters and keep your brains at home. Still, it is highly avoidable.\n\nRATING","[""Comedy"",""Romance""]","""2015-01-23""","""police""","""1H38M""",7.0

He thus embarks on a journey through love, looking through twelve girls to find the one who fits his horoscope."",""","""There is plenty to criticize about Ashutosh Gowarikar&apos;s What&apos;s Your Rashee. For instance its infinite length, fact that Harman can&apos;t act Saala, some Gujju not so funny dragging sections, but there is one thing that really can&apos;t be ignored is Priyanka Chopra on screen in twelve different forms with costume designer working on her wardrobe one after another and mostly handing her almost backless Cholis. Guy is Chicago settled NRI Yogesh (without h) Patel who is being tricked to fly back India (same as in Hadippa second in this week), has a task at this hand. Find a bride in seven days, marry the girl possibly rich and payback the debts of his uncle with dowry and fortune he will be inheriting for writing birthday cards to his rich maternal grandfather. Jetlagged or strained on one insomniac night he picks up a book same as film&apos;s title and decides to meet one girl of each rashee (sun sign).\n\nHe meets one after another caricature girl with distinct trait, a good natured Virgo doctor, a sensuous sagi saadhvi (astrologer), a mysterious Scorpio with passion for modeling, a business hotshot looking for contract marriage and prenup agreement, a minor Gaaon Ki Gori, a Cancerian with a past, a plucky Gemini, odd fish Pieces who believes in reincarnation and soul mate and there are many more. Most of them come with a song-n-dance routine and many are good distracters.\n\nAstrology is fascinating stuff. I remember jumping on Goodman&apos;s Love sings and Sun signs, parallel cross checking with each girl guy traits I know of. It was fun and sometimes astonishingly interesting read. So does our reputed director of Lagaan and Swades trying reinventing himself with a comedy cum musical succeed? Not really and I am not surprised. There is already a problem with this kind of premise as twelve characters will be fighting for screen time, limiting character developments and lack of coherent story but at the same time it can be funny vignettes quilted together with a common thread. Unfortunately writer-director Ashutosh Gowarikar lacks the comic flair required for this kind of material to pull off an interesting encounters one after another. He seriously needs a good editor who can chop and cut the flab instead of stuffing it with each and everything you shoot (three hours plus for a comedy? come on!). Harman Baweja is as bland and flat as they can get. Leading guy demands charismatic persona that can click with audience as a groom running on stopwatch looking for the perfect bride in game of luck and chance. Gowarikar also can use a new casting- director.\n\nSo saving grace is Priyanka Chopra with her screen presence keeps it going. Despite limitation of script she survives the challenge and walks out clean from this astro-mess of a story. Honestly I wasn&apos;t grossly disappointed as I switched off my brain when found what movie is up to (it took half an hour to introduce Priyanka Chopra). Instead, fancied lying on couch on one of those late nocturnal sleepless nights in front of my TV set with a glass of beer. If you decide to watch it anyway, my advice will be, don&apos;t take any of it serious, feel like catching it on tube and you might enjoy it rather than resenting.

A series of photographs becomes a motion picture and tells a story.\n\nThe story that director-writer Ritesh Batra tells in &quot;Photograph&quot; is of a street photographer, Rafi (Nawazuyddin Siddique) in Mumbai, India&apos;s most populous city. He hawks his service to anyone who&apos;ll pay 50 rupees. One day he approaches a young woman (a mousy Sanya Malhotra) and offers her a cut-rate price. He snaps her and produces her portrait from his portable printer, but she&apos;s called away before he can complete the transaction.\n\nOn the way to his flat, which he shares with three or four other bachelors, he hears that his grandmother is not taking her medications because he hasn&apos;t found a girl to marry. So he sends his grandmother, Dadi, a copy of the woman&apos;s photo, claiming that she is his girlfriend. Dadi, who lives in a village several hundred miles away, notifies Rafi that she is on the way to check things out.\n\nHow can Rafi find the girl in a city of 20 million? Fortunately a photo resolves the problem. A billboard advertising an accounting school shows the young women, Miloni, as its top student. By persistently taking a bus that picks up people near the school, Rafi meets Miloni and persuades her to pretend to be his girlfriend as long as Dadi is in town. For various reasons, including that she can no longer abide her parents making decisions for her (even telling her what her preferred color is), Miloni agrees.\n\nDadi (a scene-stealing Farrukh Jaffar) arrives and starts asking questions about Miloni, whom she knows as Noorie, the name Rafi made up for his &quot;girlfriend.&quot; Rafi and Miloni devise their backstory, and Dadi seems satisfied--or is she? Meanwhile, Miloni&apos;s parents have other plans for her.\n\n&quot;Photograph&quot; takes the viewer all over Mumbai--from its squalor to its middle-class neighborhoods, which is where Miloni resides. Her family can afford to send her to the United States with a potential bridegroom who has difficulty controlling his weight. Rafi, on the other hand, is struggling to pay off the debts of his late father.\n\nThe film could use some judicious editing. A taxi scene with Rafi arguing with the driver seems out of place. And it takes awhile before you can tell that Rafi and Miloni actually have more than just a tentative connection.\n\n&quot;Photograph&quot; has an unexpected ending. Yet it appropriately bookends its opening. Remember this is a motion picture, not just a photograph."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama"",""Romance""]","""2019-03-15""","""photographer""","""1H50M""",3.0

It&apos;s always important to give first-time directors a little leeway for errors. Direction may not be rocket science but debut projects often has some raw edges.\n\nMudassar was lucky enough to cast Sushmita Sen and Shah Rukh Khan together. These two nearly set the screen on fire with their sizzling chemistry in Main Hoon Na.\n\nDMG also stars Fardeen Khan and veterans like Johnny Lever and Parikshit Sahni. With such a talented cast the least one expected was a fun, watchable film. Unfortunately, DMG reminded me of a film which keeps taxiing down the runway but never really takes off.\n\nThe film opens in Trinidad with a spoiled brat son, who hopes to inherit millions from his deceased father&apos;s estate. But Tej Dhanraj, also known as Donsai (Fardeen Khan), is in for a rude shock. He has just a few days time to marry Samarpreet Kapoor (Ishitta Sharrma), a girl from rural Punjab.\n\nThis is a theme which was hugely popular in romance novels and movies in the 1960s and 1970s. The director could have kept us engrossed by taking the story to a new level. But Mudassar Aziz sticks to the tried-and-tested. Samarpreet remains the &apos;sati savitri&apos; type, who will go to any lengths to woo her husband.\n\nBut this Herculean task cannot be managed single-handedly. So Samarpreet receives help from Shimmer (Sushmita Sen) and Pawan Raj Gandhi (SRK). Shimmer is ashamed of Donsai&apos;s behavior. She hopes to reform him but fails to realize that she is equally commitment phobic. Mudassar in text-book fashion introduces his characters in the first 30 minutes and then for the next two hours, the film keeps plodding its way towards a dreary, predictable end.\n\nAll the characters in the film are flat and one-dimensional. Fardeen Khan, the playboy, has fared well in comic situations with his earlier hits such as Heyy Babyy and No Entry. But his performance here can&apos;t be compared to those. He has gained a lot of weight and appears bloated in most scenes.

If you want to start to get to know the greatness of this cultural tradition, this is a good place to start, and I recommend watching it thirty times.  It is still my favorite after some months of searching out Bollywood classics.\n\nThis movie provides a sublime pathway to love of Bollywood; for one thing the music is completely enchanting, beginning with the first song, sung by Raj Kapoor in his role as a university- educated (&quot;B.A. passed&quot;) young country fellow garbed as a hobo on his way to Bombay--he sings his song of the road about &quot;My shoes are Japanese, my trousers are British, my red hat is Russian, but my heart is Indian&quot; --Mera juta hai Japani, etc.  I do not speak Hindi and I have had to memorize it. I think some westerners may believe that the music of Bollywood movies will be a stumbling-block, but see if you still think that after you see this one.  The songs are compelling and varied, the lyrics elaborate story elements, with the additional pleasure of being Indian or non-Western or whatever in their sentiments. Raj Kapoor&apos;s brilliant physicality and body language alone make the movie a joy.\n\nIt also provides the pleasures of screen romance with powerful chemistry (between Raj Kapoor and the great star Nargis, his real life inspiration and beloved), and of movement into the nightclub world of the rich and glamorous, and the opportunity to see the spectacularly handsome Raj change from a foolish-acting tramp/clown to a worldly charmer in a dinner jacket (even though this spells temporary trouble for the forgotten and virtuous Nargis).\n\n~Virginia"",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Crime"",""Drama""]","""1955-09-06""","""famous song,hole in shoe,on the road,hitchhiking,money""","""2H48M""",67.0

Throughout the film, the &quot;change room door&quot; in the bar signifies the actual life of helplessly trapped women on one side of the door, and the &quot;pretentious women&quot; on the other side of the door who make a living by selling themselves.\n\nIn conclusion the film has been very well put together, and has an excellent direction (worthy of film awards).\n\nI have had tears rolling down my cheeks over ten times when I watched this film, and I suggest you view it with someone who has very little respect for women or views them as sex object.

In this portion, the aficianado of Bollywood ladies has plenty of opportunity to admire the very sexy Kim Sharma as Jai&apos;s childhood friend Sonia, and also of course his new love Neha played by Kareena Kapoor, who is more restrained in her sexiness but just demurely lovely. But after about 30-40 minutes, the pace and tone completely changes with one dramatic moment, and after that we are very much engaged in a helter-skelter action movie with multitude plot twists, wide-ranging shifts of location from India to Dubai to South Africa and even (I think) a small vignette in London, and a fair share of unarmed combat and exploding gunshot wounds.

Both the camera work and music actually detracting from the film.\n\nAmitabh Bachchan plays one of the most respected news presenters, a man of integrity, who lives by his principles and runs his now declining news channel by the same. His son, Sudeep, just back from USA is hungry for success, is nervous, twitchy, short-tempered and also game for some shortcuts. Rajat Kapoor, his brother in law, is an industrialist who dreams big and has aligned himself with a politician, Paresh Rawal, who also dreams big, is tired of being in the opposition. Suchitra Krishnamoorthy works for Amitabh&apos;s channel, Mohnish Bahl used to but now has his own channel, which is the number one channel in TRP terms. Enter Riteish Deshmukh, who idolises &amp; is inspired by Amitabh, to join the world of news.\n\nAll the dilemma&apos;s presented are real, tangible and identifiable. We all face them in our own ways. To go for the inconvenient truth or the happier compromisewhere no one but the faceless public gets shortchanged ? Every time we break a queue, bribe an official, shut our eyes at an injustice around us, we&apos;re falling into the same trapthe trap of a thousand cuts. And, God help us, but what if there is this fundamental value misalignment amongst members of a family ? What if the son-in-law, the son and the father seem to believe in different things, have different objectives ? We can then easily understand how someone like Amitabh feels as the edifice he&apos;s built around him begins to show cracks. And what someone like Riteish feels as he see&apos;s truth being sacrificed at the altar of the highest bidder.\n\nAll performances were credible, Riteish (very believable), Paresh, Rajat, Sudeep (slightly over-strung) but Amitabh Bachchan for me continues to mesmerizethere is a dignity, a believability that shines through in his every expression.\n\nNow for the disappointing bits. Its almost as if the film makers felt the subject alone wasn&apos;t good enough and so decided to go for cutting edge camera angles and really loud background soundtrack to mask the film, heighten the tension. It actually was not needed, the subject matter and performances were good enough, they didn&apos;t need gimmicks like this or the abandoned national anthem. There were some obvious flaws. You would probably keep your helmet visor down if you were trying to follow someone incognito nor follow so closely. And maybe you would put your phone on silent when in the vicinity of someone you&apos;re trying to &apos;sting&apos; ? Also, I felt the women characters were sadly shown as mere puppets throughout the filminconsequential pawns in the hands of the men who controlled their destiny. Surely more could&apos;ve been made of the combined acting talents of Simone, Neetu Chandra, Gul Panag and Suchitra ? Its definitely worth a watch, Amitabh&apos;s performance alone worth the price of a ticket. And there is food for thoughtnow if only the damned music wasn&apos;t cluttering up the mind.

There are very few such brave and worth mentioning efforts which come to your mind instantly. Luckily we have seen some good thrillers in the recent times by the young brigade of innovative directors and &quot;The Stoneman Murders&quot; is yet another path breaking and engrossing attempt by the director, Manish Gupta.\n\nThe movie is a mix of real life take on the serial killings of 1983 with a touch of fiction added by the writers giving it a more sensational feel. It talks about the horrifying terror on the streets, spread by a brutal killer who used to kill the poor people sleeping on the roadside by crushing their head with a stone, therefore named as Stoneman Murderer. And both the director and the writers come up with a brilliant portrayal of this real life case on the silver screen.\n\nThe main merit of the movie is that it straight away starts off with the main topic and sticks to its till the end. There are no deliberately added sub plots, songs or any comic scenes which make it more harsh, bold and impressive. The whole narration revolves around Kay Kay Menon, who is a suspended Police Inspector paying the price for his anger practiced in an interrogation. After his suspension, he is still investigating the Stoneman Case, privately on the instructions of his senior, Vikram Gokhale and also gets assistance by a Hawaldaar played by Virendra Saxena. His colleague inspector, Arbaaz Khan, who is more of an opponent, is also working on the same case creating troubles for KK.\n\nWhat makes the movie, a path-breaking attempt is the dark &amp; shocking secret behind all the murders committed by the Stoneman. It also shows the ugly side of our rotten system we are all living in. As the search progresses, KK manages to solve the case, but his superiors don&apos;t let the secret come out in the open for some good reasons of their own. So the case which was duly solved by him, still remains as an unsolved murder mystery in the police records due to its disgraceful truth. I will not like to disclose the mystery here for my friends as that is main highlight of the movie, but i would surely like to add that the twist has a great shock element in store for the viewers.\n\nOne more interesting observation is that despite the fact that the movie is based on some brutal and cruel murders committed by a psychopath; still it does not have any bloody or weird visuals. The director very impressively gives you a clean and sober picture without moving into some trance or blood-shed. Instead he chooses to show the real news paper pictures to show the murders committed by the killer on the roadsides. Among the well shot sequences, capable of making you jump on the edge of your seat is the sub-way sequence, when KK has a scuffle with the killer but he manages to escape, injuring KK badly. The interval sequence also leaves you awestruck, with your jaws open, asking for more.\n\nPerformance wise, KK as expected delivers another gem of his career. The complete movie moves more around him and he manages to carry it all with elegance and conviction. Vikram Gokhale is impressive once again and perfectly suits the role. Arbaaz has got few scenes and he does a fine job. Rukhsaar as KK&apos;s wife though doesn&apos;t get a well defined role, but still gives a sober and sweet performance. Virendra Saxena as KK&apos;s associate Hawaldaar is one of the most under-rated character artists we have. I still remember his haunting presentation of a Sikh Freedom Fighter in the Tele-Serial &quot;Tamas&quot; and since then have seen him giving many memorable performances in several movies consistently.\n\nIn a murder mystery or a thriller, background music has a very important role to play and this department is handled well by the music director giving ample support to the subject and feel. The movie is majorly shot at nights and still you are not taken into dark visuals and dim lightning. So the Cinematography is perfect keeping the scenes bright with proper lighting and effects.\n\nIn all, if you are fan of thrillers and murder mysteries, then this is a treat to watch after the recent &quot;A Wednesday&quot;. It was indeed a pity that I watched the movie in an almost empty theater. Attempts like these need to be applauded and encouraged by the viewers. But sadly, the Indian movie lovers still go to the theater looking at the faces on the poster and not due to the subject or theme of the movie. I would also like to thank and congratulate Mr. Bobby Bedi (Kaleidoscope), for backing up such projects in these tough recession times.\n\nSo, here is another surprising small movie, simply not to be missed."",""reviewRating""","[""Crime"",""Drama"",""Mystery""]","""2009-02-13""","""timeframe 1980s,serial killer,suspense,unsolved mystery,mumbai killings""","""1H35M""",13.0

And the other exciting feature of the movie was its theme of Time Travel into the future. These were the thoughts in the mind of every viewer before seeing the movie. But after watching it the viewer feels dejected with some sad feelings for the hard working debutant Harman.\n\nNo doubt the movie is Grand and well made technically but it lacks gravely on the script level as the viewer never seems to be into the narration at any moment. The excitement of watching a Time Travel movie drops drastically as nothing happens in the first hour and we are just watching a love story of a boy trying to win over a girl.\n\nThe other sad part of the movie is that intentionally or unintentionally Harman is quite similar in looks with Hrithik Roshan and that&apos;s a drawback for him. He impresses with his dance and acts well but exactly in the same manner of Hrithik. So in future he will have to work out a different identity of his own putting more efforts towards the same. Priyanka looks good and sports him in his debut venture. Boman Irani becomes too excited in some scenes but Archna Puran Singh manages to entertain in her few scenes.\n\nSpecial Effects are good but the future interpretation is not so impressive with excessive use of robots, flying elements and computrised interiors. Mention of Hypnotism in 2050 is also quite innovative of the script writer. While watching the future you never seem to be excited enough which takes away the spirit of watching a so called science fiction. In fact the 2050 factor has only been used to add a USP to the film and it has not been worked upon well.\n\nDirector Harry Baweja had a good idea but the execution lacked in many departments. I wish he had taken more inspiration from the Hollywood movies on similar theme. Musically Anu Malik has surely added new stock to his sound library but has come up with only few melodious tunes.\n\nInspirations to the movie include &quot;Back To the Future&quot; series &amp; &quot;Time Machine&quot;. The sequence of Priyanka dying in an accident is highly inspired. In the English version the hero goes back in the past to change the happenings and tries to save his girlfriend. But each time he goes back she dies in a different manner. That part of the plot is more interesting than going into the future and winning over the girl again. If you surely want to enjoy the Time Machine rides then you must watch the three movie series of &quot;Back To The Future&quot;.\n\nIn all the movie which is a launch pad for Harman Baweja could have been much better with all the backing of a huge budget.

He has more comedy scenes than in HMJ, and performs well in them. What&apos;s surprising about Dutt is that he matches Govinda step by step in all the songs. Unlike HMJ, in Jodi No.1 Dutt manages to hold on his own. Dutt got a much better deal than in HMJ. I think the role should keeps his fans like me happy.\n\n Twinkle and Monica Bedi doesn&apos;t have much scope to perform, except look sexy and glamorous. I wasn&apos;t too keen on first when I heard Monica was cast opposite Dutt, but she wasn&apos;t that bad. She looks very pretty if she gets some good roles, she might make it in Bollywood. Pooja Batra does well in her cameo song.\n\nAnupam Kher, Ashish Vidhiyarti, Mukesh Rishi, Siyaji Shinde, Shakti Kapoor, Sanjay Narveraker (Dedh Phutia of Vaastav) lend good support.\n\n Don&apos;t expect a superb story in a DD film.

Sanjay (Uday Chopra in his second movie) realizes that he has been forever in love with his childhood pal Anjali (debutante Sanjana) only when he gets to know of her imminent wedding with NRI-doctor Rohit (Jimmy Shergil). He rushes off to Dehradun to try and stop the wedding and to win Anjali&apos;s heart. Rohit sees through his motive and the two suitors decide to compete with each other while leaving the final decision to Anjali. Bipasha Basu as Sanjay&apos;s friend Ria, is cast in a role very different from her earlier appearances and does a great job as usual. The film is an optimum mix of romance, comedy, emotion and drama. The performances of the main as well as the supporting cast are pretty good, even though Uday Chopra tends to go overboard with his dialogue delivery and Sanjana looks quite plastic in the emotional scenes. To it&apos;s credit, the look and the feel of the movie is fresh. The songs (e.g. Jaage Jaage, Ek Ladki and the title song) are very hummable.

Played by Prakash Jha, the character of Ratan Tomar is a male chauvinist, regressive personality who believes that the women of the family strictly belong to the kitchen and for rearing of children. Such stifling is the environment in the household that the freedom of opinions itself is a far cry, leave aside women&apos;s empowerment and liberation. It feels like another place and another time centuries back and urban viewers may not even be able to associate with it. Saand Ki Aankh is the battle cry of Chandro and Prakashi against the regressive male supremacist attitude and their determination to beat the odds to prove that nothing is impossible to achieve.\n\nBhumi Pednekar and Taapsee Pannu play the characters perhaps more than twice their age with aplomb. It&apos;s a testament to the fact that talent transcends the barrier of age, and the new generation of actors can compete shoulder to shoulder with their more experienced peers. Prakash Jha instills fear and hatred. Although a biopic, the film has an interesting pace that doesn&apos;t let the momentum flag. Debutante director Tushar Hiranandani infuses the narrative with enough poignancy and the right dose of emotions to ensure that the viewer sympathy continues to remain with the protagonists. The makeup of the two women could have been better perhaps, for at times they appear a little too sprightly and bright for their age.\n\nWatch Saand Ki Aankh to be reminded that life&apos;s still quite tough for a lot of people, but then there are a few among them who are ready to catch the bull by the horn and hit the bullseye."",""reviewRating""","[""Biography"",""Drama""]","""2019-10-25""","""sharpshooter,old lady,triumph of the human spirit""","""2H26M""",3.0

One Shot Nandu, as he is called, fights blindfolded every week for Satta King(Piyush Mishra) and lays his opponent low with one blow, always wins. Pinky, dreams of making it big by winning a reality show but an accident takes away her eye sight and then she is supported by Nandu to refocus her goal. Dekhne ko aankh nai keeda maangta hai. This is the lesson he gives to Pinky. She starts using her all sense organs to offset the absence of sight. Together they form an unlikely pair, but as fate had decided they fell in love and with predictable twists and turns they finally achieve their goals.\n\nThe movie is a predictable ride from the beginning, but the typical Mumbai lingo along with fine performances of specially supporting actors prevent you from looking at your watch and the ceiling. The first half is slow and little boring but the skate dancing in the second half is the saving grace. Many scenes do bring smiles and laughs during the movie.\n\nNeil Nitin is evolving. He has done extremely well. Deepika is finally learning to act. This is her finest performance to date. Piyush Mishra is exceptional. As stated earlier, the supporting actors have done a brilliant job. Music by R. Anandh is good. Special note for the song Man Lafanga sung by Mohit Chauhan. Choreography is top notch. Bosco-Caeser are sure to get many accolades for the skate dancing in the climax of the movie. Dialogues by Gopi Puthran are hilarious. Action and cinematography are OK. Pradeep Sarkar of Parineeta and Laga Chunari Me Daag fame surely has attempted a very different genre this time. He doesn&apos;t succeed, nor he fails. The movie is perfect mixture of entertainment and boredom. Seldom you get bored and often you laugh.\n\nTo conclude, I would say go for it, if you are looking for a complete masala Bollywood flick and some brilliant skate dancing. \n\nMy Rating","[""Action"",""Drama"",""Music""]","""2010-08-20""","""contest,love,blind girl,falling in love,skating""","""2H6M""",12.0

That however doesn&apos;t imply that this movie is bad by any stretch of imagination. On the contrary, I found it to be excellent and recommend everyone to watch it, however uncomfortable it might it be.\n\nThe movie navigates a rape case from its inception to its verdict. Akshaye Khanna and Richa Chaddha lead the cast and play the role of lawyers, representing the accused and the victim respectively. In one of the introductory scenes, Khanna is shown explaining the difference between law &amp; justice. Rape is an extremely serious, unforgivable and delicate issue affecting India and the rest of the world. There have been multiple movies depicting stories &amp; tribulations of rape victims which take us through their journey in seeking justice.\n\nThis movie is not quite that. Rather, the movie takes a step back and introduces some formerly unexplored nuances emerging in a rape case &amp; showcases the perspective of the accuser, which makes the movie an extremely uncomfortable watch. I expected the movie to have a divisive reception, and after browsing through some critic and user reviews, I was right. Some reviews tagged the movie as being misogynistic. I honestly don&apos;t agree with this sentiment. Though the movie ventures into really controversial territories, I still found the movie to be an earnest and unbiased attempt at depicting what it was trying to. I feel this is an excellent movie and recommend everyone to try it out and form your own opinion.\n\nLet&apos;s get back to the review itself. Almost right away, the audience is presented with the rape scene. The accuser is a film director, played by Rahul Bhat and the victim is a young girl helping with the film&apos;s costumes, played by Meera Chopra. You know what has happened from the get go; but do you really? The rest of the film navigates through that and makes us question our preconceptions. Throughout the film, you are presented with alternating scenarios of this scene which makes you question what really happened. The way these different scenarios are presented immediately reminded me of Meghna Gulzar&apos;s fantastic Talwar.\n\nThe performances are good. Rahul Bhat as the accuser does a good job and so does Meera Chopra as the victim. Richa Chaddha is reliable as always and does what she can with what she is given. And that is my biggest gripe with this film. The movie for some reason never really dives deeper into her character. Even in the courtroom, she is usually shown as being reactive rather than proactive trying to object what the opposing lawyer is bringing up, most of the time being overruled by the judges. Similarly, the opposing lawyer gets multiple scenes outside the courtroom walking us through his mind and how the case is affecting his life. We get none of this with Richa, and that is very disappointing.\n\nThe movie also has some production rough edges, especially with editing. The transition between scenes was too jarring sometimes to overlook. Sandhya Mridul plays the opposing lawyers wife and her character feels unidimensional and merely a means an entity to reflect the protagonist&apos;s thoughts. Kishore Kadam and Kruttika Desai play the judges, the former putting in a great performance as always.\n\nThis brings us to the titular character of this movie and that is the lawyer defending the accused, played by Akshaye Khanna. The movie rests squarely on his shoulders and he bravely carries it. He dons the shoes of Tarun Saluja, a no frills lawyer trying to fight the most difficult case of his career. He is shown working pro bono for the underprivileged but also charging a fortune for his regular cases. It is very easy to hate on him at times when he is trying to exploit loopholes in the system to defend the accuser. He works according to his own code and lives with his own set of ideologies. This is a difficult role to play and Akshaye excels and delivers what I feel is one of his career best performances. After a break, it&apos;s great to have an actor of his caliber back.\n\nThe movie is well directed and written and kept me me engaged throughout. I recommend you to give the movie a chance. It is possible that you will end up hating the movie and I get that. But I urge you to form your opinion after watching it yourself. I give it a solid 8/10 rating."",""reviewRating""","[""Crime"",""Drama"",""Mystery""]","""2019-09-13""","""courtroom drama,rape case,wrongfully convicted,surprise ending""","""2H4M""",3.0

Two copywriter brothers have lost in pop music contest called Jhankaar Beats for the last two years. They take the help of an apprentice to compete in a music contest."",""","""Freshman Director Sujoy Ghosh tells a ripping good tale of two bosom buddies who &quot;work&quot; at an advertising agency but in reality only live for one thing  to win the music competition Jhankaar Beats! Every year they get oh so close but always fall short. The more grounded Deep (Sanjya Suri)) is married to Shanti (Juhi Chawla), has a daughter and is about to become a father yet again. The more uncaring and Bindaas Rishi (Rahul Bose) is married to Nicki (Rinke Khanna), a successful lawyer, but the marriage is troubled and heading towards Splittsville. Both Deep and Rishi know that they need a guitarist to really have a chance at the competition and that is when a guitarist in the shape of Neel (Shayan Munshi) is thrown their way as the no-good son of the boss at the agency. Neel loves Preeti (Riya Sen) but is unable to say a coherent word in her presence. There is a condom campaign that needs to be put together and there is tough competition from the voluptuous andunscrupulous employee (Archana Puran Singh) of the rival agency. There are the extremely coochie-coo and &quot;active&quot; neighbors upstairs, the pigeon that loves Rishi&apos;s car, the Boss, and the fact that Basanti did not dance for Veeru but to save her own skin! \n\nThe film is a delicious concoction of music, outrageous hilarity and some thought provoking looks into the institution of marriage, and the interplay between hobbies, obsessions and occupations. The ensemble cast is highly competent and every single actor does a good job. Sanjay Suri does a decent job as the serious one, but is clearly one upped by Rahul Bose who stands out in the role of Rishi. The newcomer Shayan is competent, Rinke Khanna and Riya Sen work in their roles. Archana Puran Singh is hilarious as the sexpot in a role she manages to do spot on every time. Shashikala is the intrusive mother-in-law, good to see her back. But for me the show stealer is Juhi Chawla as the pregnant Shanti, a portrait of serenity, responsibility, love and fun. She is the high point of Jhankaar Beats. The film has some excellent moments with references to RD Burman, and Sholay and even to the current culture of meditation in an age where clubbing and pop music rule. It was just a bit long and could have been trimmed by about half an hour  but even in this long version it is a rare treat indeed. The music by Vishal Shekhar is excellent and my favorite numbers are Tu Aashiqui hai, and the evergreen Hame Tumse Pyaar Kitna in a very unique variation."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Music"",""Romance""]","""2003-06-20""","""advertising,pregnant wife,music contest,divorce,condom""","""2H23M""",19.0

He prefers lots of unnecessary movement in takes but I heartily appreciate him for keeping his vision very clear about this sensational issue. So, he kept writers group very focused about his wants. The Urdu fonts used in credit and title are creatively overboard. I got it while watching the film otherwise I was unable to get it. You can easily get the feel that it is written by more than one writer, actually there are four here. Due to this movie is not seamless. You enjoy the movie in bits and pieces. Over all writers Sanjay Sharma, Alpesh Dixit, Vijay Desai and Vedish Jhaveri work is good. They are excellent in dialogues but average in screenplay. Parallel cut of protagonist learning religious rituals is realistic, funny and intelligent but snatching file in orphanage office is typical filmy. There is one great shot used as metaphor, which is riding motorcycle by protagonist in three different looks, which reflects that common person is being sandwiched between religion. I loved this one. Then visualization of protagonist that he is approached by another religion is irritating. The main drawback of this film is less emotional quotient. The family bond is not established well, even the love track is bad. Both these notes are the soul of movie but due to not established well, you feel that why is he doing all this? Movie takes a slow start then grabs pace, again slows down after interval then picks up. Pre climax is slow, climax is average. The excuses made by protagonist time to time by covering his lie is cute and fresh i.e coming in Father gate up, excuse of wearing a particular cap. Over all you enjoy the movie. Performance wise Naseerudin Shah as Neelanand Baba is excellent in his brief role. He takes every word to a different level. Annu Kapoor as Nawab Mehmood..... is very impressive. He touches your heart by putting the right amount of emotions in words. Paresh Raval as Dharmpal is great. Murli Sharma as Imam is very good.

The film is interesting and flows very well despite a somewhat slow pacing. I found the film artfully intriguing and very well narrated. The film belongs to Kareena Kapoor, who finally gave her first noteworthy performance. She does look a bit caricaturish in some scenes, but overall she is very convincing, charming and touching as a prostitute who is more of a prankster who somehow enjoys life and does not take it too seriously. Rahul Bose turns in a very fine and believable portrayal. The music is beautiful, the cinematography is effective, and the film is generally realistic and very entertaining.

It is more of a painting or a poetry in motion. These are films where story is the main actor each and every detail of which is done up to a fine precision. This film is now regarded by many as a classic and I wonder if it was appreciated as much when the film was released. Surely this film is one dimension less compared to the infinite dimensional Pyaasa; and perhaps this is a reason for its commercial failure. On the other hand, Pyaasa has impressed so many that it was also remade in Telugu (a south Indian language) by name &quot;Mallepoovu&quot; starring Shobhanbabu and Lakshmi. In comparison, the failure of KKP made Gurudutt further direct such artistry later. Of course, a film maker should make films close to his heart than worrying its saleability; but at the same time an appreciation would make him doubly sure that there are people supporting him in his works. Thus I feel that appreciating a work of art much later is no less criminal compared to killing the art itself. Sometimes people escape by saying &quot;it was ahead of its times&quot;. My sincere request to anyone reading this review, is to appreciate things at the right time.\n\nKKP is a film where director plays the main role; i mean the main character in the film is a director. It is easy now to guess that the story revolves around film industry. The story is set in the period where anything in the film industry was considered a taboo; particularly in &apos;high society&apos; people. The director in those days is the final authority with respect to the choice of location, story and the crew (acting and technical) and the producer is limited to money matters. Our director in the film, Suresh Sinha is one such. He made lot of successful films that earned lots of money for the production company.\n\nSuresh is now making a film Devdas and is looking for an actor for the role Paro. On one fateful rainy evening, he meets Shanti, an young girl shivering with cold. Suresh gives his warm coat to her and he leaves in hurry to Bombay. Shanti comes to Bombay to return his coat and is also searching for a job. He offers the Paro role to her and both get on well and they understand each other. They admire each other. Suresh is married and his wife stays away from him since he is a filmy person; also he is not allowed to meet his daughter, Pammi, who is in a boarding school at Dehradun. Once Suresh is hurt badly in an accident, on listening to this the reaction of his wife is &quot;if he needs me,then send him to Delhi (from Bombay, where the Hindi film industry is based)&quot; and this best describes their relation. Suresh sees her daughter in the doll belonging to her. Pammi&apos;s friends in school tells her that his father is involved with an actress (I wonder how small girls are even allowed to read such film magazines in those times! perhaps in boarding schools it is possible? keep my fingers crossed!). Then this small girl Pammi runs from the school and reaches Bombay. She meets Shanti and takes a promise from her that Shanti would leave all her work in Bombay and go away from Suresh&apos;s life. Shanti leaves Bombay, leaving behind her memories in a sweater that she made for Suresh.\n\nWith a suffering heart like the river longing for the fish that has been separated from it, Suresh has become a dried ocean. people refuse to give him any work and some of them say &quot;you are not fit for direction!&quot; Suresh loses all his wealth in next two years and his house auctioned and he leaves his house with two cherished things that he would not lose till he lost his life","[""Romance""]","""1959-01-02""","""director,drinking,in laws,tragic event,death of protagonist""","""2H28M""",63.0

Especially those sensitive moments are portrayed in the most beautiful manner. For example, when Mithilesh (played by Rajpal Yadav) meets his to be wife for the first time, you can feel the tingling sensation within  i.e., the same sensation when you &apos;saw&apos; your spouse for the first time before marriage.

The background score keeps the tempo intact. Some of the scenes and circumstances needed much detail, it never went over board being too dramatic.

Thank God, he isn&apos;t just &quot;Steve Stifler&quot; anymore.\n\nGoon is a feel good movie which is simple yet compelling and a bit too bloody for a sports movie.

The severe menace of piracy had robbed the sheen out of the films of those times. Due to a shrinkage in market, producers indulged in cost-cutting techniques resulting in substandard productions. Poor picture quality, inferior production-values and cheap disco-numbers took away the glamour quotient of the films. Facing a budgetary constraint, film-makers started focusing more on kitchen-sink dramas to woo the lower middle-class audiences. Even when there was some action, they were way below the 70&apos;s standards.\n\nBut from time-to-time, there were the big-ticket ventures like &apos;Karma&apos; (1986), &apos;Mr.India&apos; (1987), &apos;Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak&apos; (1988), &apos;Ram Lakkhan&apos; (1989), &apos;Maine Pyar Kiya&apos;(1989), &apos;Tridev&apos; (1989), etc which offered some much needed respite from the constant nightmare of mediocrity. One of those films was N.N.Chandra&apos;s &apos;Tezaab&apos;(1988).\n\nWhen I saw the film 2 years back, I wasn&apos;t much impressed as I felt the script was quite wayward and overall not good enough. But after being exposed to some more regular 80&apos;s fare, I happened to watch this film recently again. And this time I was just blown away!\n\nI have realised that I wasn&apos;t being fare to this film by judging it solely on the basis of it&apos;s script; as compared to the regular 80&apos;s fare, this film offered so much more! First of all, this was a big- budget film. From the picture quality, sets and locales to its hard- hitting action, the film was shot on a huge scale. The film has a sort of grandeur which is bound to be a breath of fresh air for cine-goers of those times.\n\nBut for me, the 3 assets of the film are its dialogues, editing and background music. The dialogues are extremely hard-hitting and create a severe impact. The editing is extremely fast-paced and makes a solid impact from the opening scene itself. In fact it could even compete with any film of the mid-2000 period. On this front, the film was clearly way ahead of its time! And Laxmikant-Pyarelal seem to have given their all in creating a high-voltage background score that turbo-charges the film non-stop for the entire duration. That&apos;s not to say, they fared any worse when it came to the songs. &apos;Kehdo Ki Tum&apos;and &apos;So Gayi Yeh Zameen&apos; deliver the goods with &apos;Ek Do Teen&apos; remaining a timeless classic till now!\n\nPerformance is another strong point for the film. Almost the entire cast comprising of Anil Kapoor, Madhuri Dixit, Anupam Kher, Kiran Kumar, Annu Kapoor, etc deliver some power-packed performances. But it&apos;s Suresh Oberoi who stands out as the righteous and sympathetic cop, who ensures justice is finally delivered at the end. Even Chunky Pandey delivers a surprisingly heart-felt performance which is probably his best act till date. This was one of Johny Lever&apos;s earlier films and he is as usual wonderful; especially in the Telugu-mouthing Arabian act! Mandakini appears in a small cameo in what is probably the only poorly etched out character.\n\nMany might consider the &apos;Ek Do Teen&apos; number to be the highlight of the film; but for me the highlight was the demolition sequence of Lotiya Pathan&apos;s empire. With explosions, car-crashes, collapsing towers this was one of the most expensive action-sequences back then and clearly takes one&apos;s breath away! Even on the 1st occasion when I didn&apos;t like the film, I was still blown away by this particular sequence. In fact the sequence is so good, that I expected this to be the grand-climax for the film. But I was quite surprised to see that the film still went on for another half-an-hour. Still after watching a sequence like this, one expected the climactic battle to be even more stunning. But the final confrontation, filmed aboard a ship, simply drags on and falls way below expectations. This leaves a sour taste to an otherwise gripping drama.\n\nThe title (meaning &apos;acid&apos;) and the tag-line (&apos;A Violent Love-Story&apos;) suit the film to the tee. The script might be a bit wayward; but the performances, dialogues, music, production quality, action and above all the editing make it a riveting experience for the viewers. This high-voltage concoction generates a heavy reaction on the viewer&apos;s psyche. Although it&apos;s nowhere near Anil Kapoor&apos;s best works, it&apos;s still one of the better films of the 1980&apos;s. Overall it&apos;s a spicy potboiler that is delicious for the regular Bollywood fans; but could give &apos;acidity&apos; to those who aren&apos;t accustomed to stuffs like these!"",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Drama"",""Romance""]","""1988-11-11""","""anti hero,manslaughter,motorcycle,one word title,injustice""","""2H53M""",34.0

On the way to his out-of-city bungalow, where he decides to write the climax, he gives lift to a stranded girl in his car. As she narrates her story, his job becomes easier than he had imagined.\n\n5. Ma...\n\nA young man who saves a girl from running over by his car on a rainy night, wakes up to find himself in a lock-up, accused for a crime which he has never committed. As a stranger visits him in the station, the truth that unfolds then, seems stranger than fiction.\n\n6. Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\n\nSix brave children, misusing their school picnic freedom, hike in a forest and arrive at a haunted house where they meet an old lady who lives alone without fear. As they get friendly with each other, she challenges to scare them by narrating six frightening stories. While she stops after the fifth, the bravest kid asks her, &quot;Where is the sixth one, Dadi Ma?&quot;. He will be told.\n\nIt would take too long to review each story. Therefore, I&apos;d like to put it in a brief way. Each story has its own theme and its own shock value, though, a few similarities can be felt between The Couple and The Director (in both one tries to fool another with a scare) and also between The Director and Ma (the car, dark road, rain). Nevertheless, the rest are unique among them.\n\n&quot;Life is Risky&quot; devastates a common man&apos;s sense of self-security. It jolts but doesn&apos;t scare. Rajpal Yadav is greaaaatttt as the Insurance man. Sunil and Sonali just fit in the role. &quot;The Director&quot; is beautifully made. When Mallika narrates her story in dark, it somehow reminded me of the song &quot;Ye Sard&quot; from RGV&apos;s Bhoot. I expected more but unfortunately it ended too soon and made me feel &quot;Is that all?&quot;. Anil Kapoor and Mallika have done whats necessary. Nothing more. &quot;The Couple&quot; is slow, sensuous, playful, scary and predictable. You just cant forget that smile! Makrand shines in his role. Arjun and Bipasha have done a good job. &quot;Twinkle Twinkle Little Star&quot; is the movie&apos;s central story. Ava Mukherji is, in one word, scary! The children have dutifully performed as they have been instructed.\n\nNow the three best episodes. &quot;Ma...&quot; is a brilliant tale. Randeep is wow! Zakir is unbelievably superb. Rasika excels in her role. Are you going to Poona? In car? In the night? In rain? Beware! &quot;Boo...&quot; is the Prologue. Manoj Pahwa. Man! What a carelessly cool actor! His mother is a good diversion. She has done well too. Sorry. I wont say anything more than this.\n\nOf all the seven stories, &quot;The Professor&quot; steals the show. Amitabh! The icon of Bollywood gives one more earth shattering performance! How many more styles does he have! This episode stops you, shocks you and gives you shivers, cos you don&apos;t know whats in it and whats gonna come next. Ritesh has rendered a befitting performance. He seems more scared of Amitabh&apos;s acting skills than the scenario he is in. Cos the old man rules!\n\nThis movie on the whole has more fear and shock value than Darna Mana Hai, although I should accept that except for &quot;The Professor&quot;, DMH had much better story plots. In my opinion, the most shocking of all the 14 stories in both DMH and DZH is &quot;The Professor&quot; and the scariest of all is &quot;The Teacher&quot; from Darna Mana Hai. Overall, DMH didn&apos;t scare as much as DZH, but it made us squirm and feel creepy cos of the reality which the stories reflected. It left a long lasting impression in us. On the other hand, the shocks that DZH has in store, will hit you hard and cruel with sudden force, only when you naively think that its time to relax. Thats merciless! It shocks you. It keeps you excited. It makes you giggle with fear. And its fun. Its a different experience on the whole. Feel sorry for yourself, if you miss this great movie. And feel more sorry while watching it...\n\nHey! Look who is behind you!"",""reviewRating""","[""Horror""]","""2006-04-28""","""ghost,producer,murder,anthology""","""1H48M""",16.0

Tara and Sitara go into hiding, managing to talk their way into staying at the guest house of a high-ranking Army officer named Ram Singh who is looking for the sinister crime duo. They do this by pretending to be former owners of the home who now are homeless, Tara faking paralysis in a wheelchair. Ram Singh also just happens to have a daughter and a younger sister who take a liking to Tara and Sitara and romance ensues. In the meantime, will Cobra and Panther find Tara and Sitara and wreak vengeance? This really is a very funny film and Dutt (who often plays a scary gangster type like in Vaastav","[""Action"",""Thriller""]","""1981-12-04""","{""total"":0","""2H33M""",41.0

Amitabh&apos;s third film with Mukul Anand (after Agneepath and Hum) in a phase in which he had no hits except for Hum. When this film was launched it had sanjay Dutt in the role of Nagarjuna. But although Sanjay Dutt and Abhishek Bachchan are like brothers now and Sanjay sees Amitabh Bachchan as a father figure now there was quite a hungama between Amitabh and Sanju at that time. And only because of a song. For the movie HUM a song was recorded JUMMA CHUMMA sung by Sudesh Bhosle and kvita Krishnamurthi. Everybody knew the song was going to be a hit. But the master of copies BAPPI LAHRI took the tune and used it for THANEDAAR starring Sanjay Dutt and Madhuri Dixit and created his own Tamma Tamma Loge. Bachchan was upset and Sanjay stepped out of the movie. farah Naaz (a pretty actress- now more known as Tabus elder sister) was supposed to play Shilpa Shirodkar&apos;s role but because Sridevi had a double ole in this movie (and according to me it&apos;s her best double role ever) Farah did not have the guts to do the film and opted out. A good film with splendid performances by Bachchan and Sridevi- actually their best film of all the films they did together (Inquilaab and Aakhree Raasta beibg the other two.)."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Adventure"",""Drama""]","""1992-05-08""","""honor,shootout,showdown,tough guy,feud""","""3H13M""",30.0

But if you&apos;re just looking for a nice romantic comedy to pass the time, then this movie will do just that. It&apos;s delightful and charming, and will pull on your heartstrings at the right times too. Aishwarya Rai is stunningly beautiful as usual and she gives her character, Diya the right amount of vulnerability. Vivek Oberoi is endearing throughout the whole film. The strongest part of the film is the beginning, in my opinion. It progresses the fastest and most of the comedy is found there. I found the second half of the movie to be a bit slower. But don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s not slow enough to make your interest wane. Also, as a bonus, Amitabh Bachchan makes his appearance in the second half. Although the second half slows down a bit like I mentioned, it does lead up very well to the ending. I don&apos;t understand some of the comments made that Vivek and Aishwarya have no chemistry because I thought they had it in spades. Where this film succeeds is through the characters. The movie makes you care for them, and when they&apos;re happy, you&apos;re happy, and when they&apos;re sad, you&apos;re heartbroken for them.

Well, not really. It&apos;s a romance.

It&apos;s different, and it gave a good rhythm to the story. I also liked the fact that it wasn&apos;t too cheesy and that it focused the plot on the idea of destiny rather that on unconditional and extraordinary love.\n\nAlso, a reviewer said the film wasn&apos;t funny.

She leaves for a college reunion and meets her college sweetheart Rohit ..."",""","""The thing which I universally found in the various offices I remained associated with is the hypocrisy in the office culture. Your bosses / seniors may be having some reasons to punish / harass you but when they actually do it, upon asking the reasons, they seldom furnish the genuine reasons. Once the issue of injustice / harassment is raised by the victimized one, the oppressors cook up stories to justify what they&apos;ve (unjustly) done without admitting the truth behind that. Shilpa Shetty, Salmaan Khan and Abhishek Bachchan starrer Phir Milenge (2004) made with the backdrop of the curse of the relatively modern disease - AIDS, highlights this phenomena only.\n\nPhir Milenge (we&apos;ll meet again) is the story of Tamanna Saahni (Shilpa Shetty) who is a committed career woman, always giving her best shot to her work in the company and contributing significantly to her employer organization&apos;s growth. Her boss (Raja Krishnamoorthy) is very happy with her (due to her astounding performance in the company). However destiny lands Tamanna into trouble when she happens to meet her boyfriend Rohit Manchanda (Salmaan Khan) after many years and gets intimate with him.\n\nAfter a few days, she comes to know that she is HIV positive. Supposedly she has been caught by AIDS because of her sexual intimacy with Rohit only who himself must be an AIDS patient. Once this fact is known to others, Tamanna finds herself as expelled from her employer company and almost lonely in the world. The people from her erstwhile employers, mainly her ex-boss, are not speaking out the real reason behind her dismissal which is her being AIDS patient. Instead, they cook up false stories regarding her inefficiency and negligence to work to justify their action.\n\nWhen Tamanna decides to fight against this injustice in the court, almost everybody discourages her terming her case as a very weak one and bound to lose the legal battle. However a young advocate Tarun Anand (Abhishek Bachchan) takes up her case upon getting encouragement from his senior and mentor (Nasser) and then starts the prolonged courtroom drama in which advocate Kalyaani (Meeta Vashisht) is the counsel of her opponents, i.e., the company. Finally, the courage and conviction of Tamanna and her counsel Tarun triumphs and she gets her social respect back by winning the case against the company. However Rohit dies after apologizing to Tamanna.\n\nThis movie has been publicized and talked about as a movie making people aware of AIDS and its disastrous consequences for the affected individual plus being human to the patients. However while watching this movie, I was able to relate to it time and again not on account of the AIDS issue but on account of the hypocritical Indian work culture in which a committed, dedicated and hard-working employee is victimized on account of false reasons. How ungrateful ! How ungrateful it is on the part of the senior officials of an organization when they victimize the person who has shed perspiration, who has burnt midnight oil and who has given his / her 100% to take the organization to the heights of success. \n\nIn the courtroom drama too, it is very emphatically and realistically shown that on one hand, the lawyer of the company (Meeta Vashisht) is trying to trap the aggrieved plaintiff, i.e., Tamanna in her web of words in order to get something from her mouth which may go against her (as is always expected of shrewd and cunning lawyers), on the other, her ex-boss and other associates (being the flatterers of the boss) speak a bunch of lies (under oath) to the court telling stories about Tamanna&apos;s negligence to her duties (because the real reason for her dismissal that she&apos;s got AIDS, cannot be admitted). How hurting it is for a hard-working, sincere and committed person when his / her toil is negated in this way ! Appears strange ? But true ! Very true in the context of the work culture (unfortunately) prevailing in India.\n\nAnd now for the issue of AIDS. The movie very correctly underscores the fact that the AIDS patients are also human-beings only and just because someone has caught this virus, he / she should not be considered as characterless and treated like a leper. Just like the cases of the transgenders, gays and lesbians; the case of HIV positives also needs to be treated on humanitarian grounds. Everybody has a right to live and his / her rights as a human-being cannot be denied just because he / she is an AIDS patient or having a biological gender abnormality or having offbeat sexual preferences. An employee who was being considered an invaluable asset to the organization till yesterday, is suddenly being considered a burden just because of her disease and since this reason is totally unjustified and unacceptable (especially in the court of law), false reasons are created to be given for her dismissal; this is how our organizations function and strengthen the prejudices of the society towards those who are worthy of sympathy and support in their crisis time.\n\nThe erstwhile heroine of Tamil movies as well as a few Bollywood movies - Revathy, has directed this movie very well However Tamanna&apos;s victory in the court case in the climax sounded a bit unconvincing to me but perhaps it was essential to end the movie on a positive note and render an air of hope for future.\n\nShilpa Shetty has delivered the performance of a lifetime in this movie. This actress mainly known for her item numbers, has finally showed in Phir Milenge that she has come of age as an actress. A splendid show from her. Abhishek Bachchan and Salmaan Khan have not shared screen space. Salmaan is in a guest appearance whereas Abhishek has got a meaty role. Both of them have done well. \n\nDespite not being a masterpiece, Phir Milenge deserves a watch by all the sensitive viewers."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama""]","""2004-08-13""","""love,reunion,hospital,court,advertising agency""","""2H22M""",18.0

It is hard to believe that he was the brain behind my two most favorite films &quot;Rang De Basanti&apos; and &quot;Bhag Milkha Bhag&apos;. Not a single shot gives any glimpse of that magic in this film. Screenplay is obsolete and confusing. Writer thought that everyone is well versed with the &apos;Sahiba-Miraza&apos; story, so he didn&apos;t feel a bit of requirement to at least describe the key points of that legend story. Film goes into flashback from present frequently, whenever an emotional scene comes, an intense song but difficult to understand the lyrics takes over with some good visuals. Lyrics do not justify the two different time periods at all. Lead characters childhood scenes are too lame. First of all they don&apos;t look cute. Girl looks older than the boy. They seem of age 7 to 8 years but in pre climax it got revealed by boy that he was twelve year old that time. Boy getting late to feed girl &apos;Til Laddo&apos;, teacher show causes him for being late then asks for home work&apos;s copy, girl passes her copy to him but teacher sniffs this and then asks girl for her home work copy, eventually leading girl canned. All class give expression as if it was most unusual incident when teacher already cleared that it is well known punishment. Boy keeps mum that time then decide to retaliate in some idiotic way by shooting the teacher!!! It gives first hint that you are going to witness some crap. It is love story but you can&apos;t find a faint glimpse of love throughout. Film starts with some high octane action with support of VFX but you don&apos;t feel anything because it was not cleared that what is happening and why, actually it was just for the sake of introducing the male lead. Girl went abroad and returns back, her childhood friend is working in her Prince fiancé stable. Again some lame hide and seek identity scene. When girl recognizes the boy is so bad that I strongly felt urge to laugh but controls it with subsided smile, but then after few scenes audience started to evoke controlled giggle and then I joined them shamelessly. Surprisingly there is some weird sense of humor in most of the emotionally intense scenes, which at least save you from getting headache. Boy&apos;s Polo playing with his master then flashback of horse riding of past time. Girl wants to learn horse riding, boy trains her and all that blah blah. A key scene of tiger attacking in full moon light looks so fake and crude in the time of so advanced technology. Again thrill lost in making. In climax marriage scene, sneaking out in veil is so old fashioned scene and why that old person supported her is not clear and why that girl commits suicide is also. It was just to add drama but sorry to say it looked absurd and film is full of such type of scenes. Pre climax and climax is unbearable but yes laughter is there for sure. Performance wise all bad actors are stuffed in one film. Harshvardhan Kapoor&apos;s looks is good but he speaks stone flat. Even good actress Anjali Patil gone wasted as Zeenat.

It has also led to Bollywood making multiple films on this subject. PINK, MAATR and MOM dealt with this growing menace in recent times and now Sanjay Dutt choses this hard-hitting topic for his comeback film, BHOOMI. So does this film turn out to be an entertaining one or does it fail, let&apos;s analyse.\n\nOmung Kumar&apos;s direction is very weak. He has used all the Bollywood clichés and made the film extremely violent. Everyone is corrupt and the society is full of hypocrites in this story. Three scenes however are very well executed – when Sanjay Dutt gets new shoes for Aditi, the courtroom scene where Dutt gives a hard hitting speech and when Sanjay Dutt informs about the punishment for rape in different countries of the world to one of the victims.\n\nComing to performances, Sanjay Dutt is brilliant and his emotions look genuine. He looks convincing as a helpless father and also powerful when he takes revenge in the final scenes. The way his eyes do all the talking in the police station scene is seen to be believed. Aditi Rao Hydari is good in her part and her portrayal of a rape survivor is very impactful. You genuinely feel for her in the film. Sharad Kelkar is the best out of all the villains. He looks very convincing. Riddhi Sen (Jeetu) delivers an effective performance and he has a crucial part in the film. Veer Aryan (Ghulam) gets little scope but does fine. Puru Chibber is quite nice as the rapist as well as the helpless target of Arun. Shekhar Suman (Taj) is wasted. Sidhant Gupta does well in his cameo.\n\nSachin-Jigar&apos;s music is weak and has no scope. &apos;Will You Marry Me&apos;, played during opening credits, is the only one that works. &apos;Jai Mata Di&apos; played in the climax enhances impact. The Sunny Leone item song &apos;Trippy Trippy&apos; looks forced and is badly placed. Ismail Darbar&apos;s background score is strong.\n\nArthur Zurawski&apos;s cinematography is very good. Vanita Omung Kumar&apos;s production design is authentic and rustic. Jayesh Shikharkhane&apos;s editing is disappointing. The 135 minute long film should have been trimmed by 15-20 minutes to create the necessary impact. Javed- Aejaz&apos;s action is too gory and might put off the family audiences.\n\nOn the whole, BHOOMI comes across as a decent entertainer with power packed performance by Sanjay Dutt. At the box office, it will have to compete with other releases for its share of footfalls."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Crime"",""Drama""]","""2017-09-22""","""rape,rape and revenge,father daughter relationship,violence,fight""","""2H16M""",5.0

Lack of research work is major drawback of this film. First they tried to compensate it with a love track which is also very boring. Love track worsens it further and applies break on already slow movie. There is nothing in the name of story, screenplay, just an information. Dialogues are impressive. What was the inspiration or idea behind making a plane is not there except that an Indian wanted to make it. Execution and obstacles both looks very unreal and childish. Somehow after watching this movie you start doubting that is it fact or fiction as they have presented it in film. Person is genius to think about making a Airplane but not even think a bit about how to control it or land it, trying comes after. Safety measures would have worked or not its another thing but not even thinking about it is not digestible. Premise is Maharashtra but you cant find it neither in language nor in set designs, only speaking few Marathi words do not justify it. Costumes are so bad that the jail dress looks like as night suit. Background score gives feeling that it is not proud of India but dedicated to a particular religion but suddenly took a U turn and started giving feeling of another religion then a tasteless combination of both. Cinematography is good but it is obsessed with pigeon, candle and focus shifting. Performance wise Ayushmann Khurana looks as if he is smiling in sad scenes.

After all, the &apos;old man falling for a young girl&apos; is not new in Hollywood by any stretch of imagination. This movie is purely for Indian audiences, many of whom may have never seen &quot;Lolita&quot;, and therefore its purpose is to introduce an &apos;alien&apos; subject to bollywood. So far, so good!!\n\nNishabd starts well. A young girl Jiah captures her friend&apos;s father&apos;s heart by being unusually carefree and unbelievably audacious. While her &apos;take light&apos; attitude is conveniently attributed to her Australian upbringing and a troubled childhood, the scenes showing Amitabh&apos;s growing attraction towards her are well presented. Here, i must mention the young actress Jiah Khan. She fits the part completely- physically and phonetically. Using her extra-provocative body language and always-uncrossed legs, she brings to life a manipulative and headstrong young girl with a selfish motive of enticing an old man. Amitabh is reliable, though monotonous, and speaks volumes through his eyes.\n\nJiah&apos;s and amitabh&apos;s growing infatuation for each other is pasted against picturesque backdrops of Munnar (kerala) and up to the interval, the movie is very much watchable ( sometimes, entertaining). As traces of sexual tension are clearly visible and the affair being still a secret form the household, you anticipate a path breaking second-half. \n\nThis is where things go wrong. By the time jiah and amitabh confront each other with their feelings, the bollywood&apos;s morality fever has returned. Nishabd makes the elementary and hackneyed mistake of grouping love and lust in the same bracket. The way the first half is shown, the only conclusion you can draw is that both the protagonists are sexually attracted to each other. Yet, the director identifies these lustful feelings as love and leaves you confused. This is, undoubtedly, done because it would have been difficult to convince the Indian people that the base of an unconventional relationship is lust, not love. Since &apos;love conquers all&apos; and is much &apos;purer&apos; and acceptable than lust, people must respect it. For, however important age difference is, love is love and it is OK if it happens to anyone, isn&apos;t it?

It deals with the armed revolt in the 1930s, against the British rulers in Chittagong, executed by a master with the participation of school boys. Subsequently, there was also a peasant uprising in the same town, led by one of the school boys, against these British rulers.\n\nThe movie is not jerky, awkward, hurried or too slow.\n\nHowever, it has taken up disproportionately more time in narrating the armed revolt and its aftermath; less time has been given to the later peasant uprising which happened in order to regain the food-grains forcibly commandeered by the Britishers.\n\nThis &apos;peaceful&apos; peasant uprising was equally interesting and should have been detailed better. There are no scenes of how much has been commandeered by the British, what was the layout map of their location vis-a-vis the food-grains godown, how they planned the tunnel routes, how they planned the digging teams, how the teams actually dug the tunnels, the travails of digging the tunnels secretly, time frames involved, the general heroism of it all. The narrative was cursory here.\n\nThere was an immediate reason for the peasants to rise against the Britishers as their lands, crops and food-grains had been forcibly commandeered by them. However, it is not clear what particular events triggered the master in Chittagong to plan a revolt. The movie could have shed some light on that. If there were no particular events which triggered, then the movie could have explored how a widespread wave of resistance to the Britishers was building up in the entire country, and how the Chittagong folks were not unaffected.\n\nDelzad Hiwale (as the young Jhunku) has acted very well. Nawazuddin Siddique, Manoj Bajpayee and Rajkummar Rao are well known actors and did well in this movie. However, a common observation for all these four actors (and particularly Manoj Bajpayee) is that their facial expressions were not so nuanced.\n\nVega Tamotia (as Pritilata Waddedar) acted well and also used facial expressions more.\n\nAll the actors in the movie have acted well. There was no amateurishness anywhere.\n\nThe good costumes did a lot in creating the period story effect in the movie. Apparently, a lot of care has been taken here. This whole thing was quite pleasing. Kudos to the Costume Designer Nilanjana Ghose.\n\nThe film location was apt, with the villages, the rural folk, the thick jungle, the rocky terrain, the single railway line and the deserted road lined with thick foliage.\n\nThis is a film production of high calibre, with good homework all around. The movie has mostly Indian actors and Indians in key non-acting roles. Only the Cinematographer and the Editor appear to be non-Indians.\n\nIt was a bit incredulous to see two bicycling policemen approaching the secret training ground inside the forest, where training to fire a rifle was being given to the school boys, and not hear the noise of the firing.\n\nThe music (songs) composing team of Shankar-Ehsan-Loy is quite popular in Bollywood.

Though the film falls short of expectations and hype garnered pre-release, there are some very good performances (in spite of a wasted presence of Anupam Kher) and of course the political observations on the infamous human rights violations and censorship carried out by the power-hungry Gandhi dynasty. That said, Neil Nithin Mukesh stands out exceptionally compared to the titular Indu Sarkar in his brilliantly etched out persona of Former MP Sanjay Gandhi, the ruthless executioner of ridiculous emergency decrees by his mummy in the 19 months of emergency! Incidents like the forced sterilization campaign of &apos;76, Turkman gate demolition and rioting in Delhi, Former PM IK Gujral&apos;s fallout with Sanjay Gandhi over the formers bid to control All India Radio and the ban on Kishore Kumar songs in radio (over his refusal to perform on one of congress rallies in Mumbai) find their way into the major unfolding of events, but still the film loses its plot halfway ending up into an average screenplay of sorts - rather focusing on the lead Indu Sarkar&apos;s transformation from a meek stammering housewife to an activist during emergency period against the government, fuelled by her first hand experience during the Turkman gate incident. The relevance of such movies might be the screen time worth it imparts to the new age audience on the ugly face of dynasty politics, shrewdly criticized all over the flick with its take on Indira Gandhi&apos;s 20 point program or the mass arrest without trial of journalists, RSS members and communist activists in a massive crackdown on civil liberties and political opposition in the name of internal security. It is paradoxical to the say the least that the same party is trying to put up a pseudo-democratic front and playing the caste and religion trump card at the slightest pretext even today, projecting the same family member decade after decade as their leader (this in spite of the numerous other eligible personalities to take up the same role, but alas not from the same family) It is no wonder that there was a stiff opposition from Congress circles in some places ahead of the movies screening , given the kind of incidents it reminds the people of. All said and done, Indu Sarkar is definitely an interesting watch for those interested in politics , partly because of the timeline of events it traces to the ultimate fall of Gandhi dynasty in 1977 and the rise of Janata party which ultimately paved the way for non congress parties to come in power !"",""reviewRating""","[""Drama"",""Thriller""]","""2017-07-28""","""prime minister""","""2H19M""",5.0

In Turkey it&apos;s described as a Yeşilçam (Film Center of Turkey ) Classic for its love story and out of Turkey it&apos;s described as &apos;&apos;Cinderella Story&apos;&apos;.\n\nThis series tells a great and real love between a poor and a very beautiful young girl from a country and a very rich and a powerful man. One day Gümüş receives a phone telling her she would be a wife of Mehmet, the grandson of Mehmet Fikri Şadoğlu who wants Mehmet to marry Gümüş. Gümüş gets very happy, because she would be a wife of a man whom she loved since her childhood. But the events don&apos;t go on as they must be. Because, there&apos;s a problem that Mehmet is in bad sorts because of having guilty conscience. Mehmet feels guilty conscience of causing the accident which his ex-girlfriend had died with his unborn baby and especially feels bad for his unborn baby. And, although he admires Gümüş&apos;s beauty when he first sees her photo which his grandfather gives before the marriage and accepts to marry her eagerly, but then the events progress in line with misunderstandings of each other. Mehmet who had many girl friends but didn&apos;t love anybody in real and who didn&apos;t want to marry any girl before, thinks she married him because of feeling bad for him and because of his grandfather&apos;s request. His grandfather was very important to her because of his big helps while growing up after she had lost her family. So, although the two of them like each other, they don&apos;t talk to each other for a while. But then while Gümüş tries to talk to him and while he tries to understand her, love between them starts to show itself. And day by day while their relationship grows stronger new problems appear to test their great and real love. Because the slogan of the series is; &apos;&apos;No love which is not tested is a real love.&apos;&apos;. So in line with that slogan everyday, their love gets tested by new problems and difficulties. First, the difficulties are by Mehmet&apos;s mother, and then two women who love Mehmet and a man who loves Gümüş and the other men making Mehmet very jealous of Gümüş and the biggest one is misunderstanding each other. And one of the problems is the appearance of Mehmet&apos;s ex-girlfriend with his son who were known as death at the accident which caused Mehmet to feel bad because of guilty conscience. Of course, there&apos;s no problem with Mehmet who already didn&apos;t love her in real before, and who just cared for his son now. But there&apos;s problem with Gümüş that she misunderstands Mehmet again and wants to leave him to his son and his son&apos;s mother. But their great real love beats everything again. \n\nAlso, by the power of their great love; the two of them changes of course. Mehmet becomes a very different man by the great love which he feels for Gümüş and Gümüş develops herself for her husband. \n\nSo, it&apos;s the best love story I&apos;ve ever watched telling a great real love of Gümüş&amp;Mehmet from the beginning, the first sight to the end beating all the problems and difficulties coming in front of them. Also, a great real love story telling the changing of the two of them for each other by the power of love, the changing which they never did for anybody before but just they did for each other. The great real love story of Gümüş&amp;Mehmet, the great real love which is hidden at first sight and appearing after a while and the beating every obstacle from the beginning to the end."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama"",""Family"",""Romance""]","""2005-01-20""","""family relationships""", ,15.0

The songs of this film are definitely and definitively representatives of the wonderful Punjabi poetry.\n\nIf I remember what I heard on TV correctly, the music for this film is as such not composed for this film but the film makers took the music of Nusrat and ACKNOWLEDGED/credited Nusrat for his music. This honesty is reflected in every department. Unfortunately, Milan Luthria could not live up to the expectations of people like me with his other offerings Chori Chori and Deewar, given the promise of his talent that was present all over Kache Dhaage. \n\nI recommend this film very strongly. God Willing, I would own a DVD of this film soon."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Drama"",""Thriller""]","""1999-02-19""","""illegitimate son,love,framed for murder,bomb,manhunt""","""2H24M""",23.0

This one line description of the film sounds pretty interesting following the current trend of teen movies. And then Shahrukh coming forward to promote the film in full spirits featuring in a peppy music video further raises the expectation level of the viewers to greater heights, especially of Shahrukh&apos;s own fans residing all over the world. In fact that was the reason why I eagerly opted for this movie before the other major releases this Friday, to actually see the contribution made by The KING himself in the movie as per the reports.\n\nBut sadly what was served to the viewers in the theater in those two tiring hours was completely out of sync, directionless and a complete mess made out of some good intentions. Directed by Roshan Abbas as his first attempt, it is said to be based on his more than a decade old play called &quot;Graffiti&quot;. The play might have been good but the film is not even close to be called a worth watching venture. Written around the problems and love life of four school friends, it seems that the director basically wants to talk about the generation gap between the kids and the parents. But very strangely this basic idea gets a clear projection, only after almost one third of the movie is over. Before that the sequences keep coming in from different directions without having any kind of relation with each other.\n\nActually the various sections of the film try to cover so many diverse aspects of the younger generation that in the end it all becomes an un- explainable chaos. For instance, suddenly from no-where a pregnancy test sequence is thrown into the movie which at once makes you think that &quot;What is this all happening?&quot; The writers try to put in whatever they can think of ranging from classroom scenes, Shakespeare, drug peddling, wanna be heroines, corrupt policemen, students suicide, a deadly accident and much more. The film goes on and on without any direction or aim and you just cannot get it.\n\nIn clear words, I seriously suspect that the project must have been started with some clear vision and a to-the-point story-plot. But with the passing time there were so many changes forcibly made into its script that it all got entangled and the result was a complete NO SHOW. Particularly the repetitive &quot;Romeo-Juliet&quot; play, the uninspiring school premises scenes and its noisy out of the place background score, really put you off and one even starts regretting his decision of watching the film. On top of it, after almost two hours of all useless drama, the director even gets confused that how should he essentially finish the film now. And then it all ends with again a supposed to be inspirational song-dance number which could have made an impact in a different film. \n\nMoreover the title of the movie also remains as confusing as its unimpressive content and I really wonder that being the producers, didn&apos;t Gauri Khan or Shahrukh see the movie while it was still in the making?\n\nTruly speaking, the only thing I enjoyed in AKK was watching Giselle Monteiro on the screen who interestingly gets a meatier role and looks more beautiful than her first film LOVE AAJ KAL. Though she still struggles in her emotional scenes and dialogue delivery but even then remains a treat to be watched on the celluloid. Zoa Morani, as the rebellion girl looks the most confident of them all and impresses. Both the boys are fine with Ali Fazal scoring above than Satyajeet Dubey, but all the seniors in the cast including Lillette Dubey, Navneet Nishaan, Satish Shah, Manoj Joshi, Mukesh Tiwari and Vijay Raaz simply do not rise above the routine.\n\nIn short, the intentions may have been right and the subject might be socially important, but it&apos;s the end result which really counts in front of the audience. And in this particular case the film is nothing more than a directionless clutter."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Crime"",""Drama""]","""2011-06-17""","""high school,high school shakespeare adaptation,motorcycle chase,texting,stage mother""","""2H6M""",11.0

A dude who was living the life. He had the works - the mansion to live in, the chicks to party with and the cars to be driven around in. Until one day, the family he was the favorite pet of, decided to ..."",""","""Am I the only non-Indian teenage boy who actually enjoyed this film? If not, that&apos;s fine with me. That&apos;s right, I watched Roadside Romeo (a wordplay on an Indian term for &apos;flirt&apos;) on DVD with English subtitles and liked it. It&apos;s probably the 2nd in a full line-up of movies about dogs from October 2008 to February 2009 (Chihuahua, Romeo, Bolt, Marley, Hotel and Vomit). Sure it may be campy at some parts, but hey, this is India&apos;s first well-animated film, so I&apos;ll cut them some slack. This film is kinda like a CGI Bollywood version of Lady and the Tramp meets All Dogs Go To Heaven, but there&apos;s nothing wrong with that. You&apos;ll need to watch some Bollywood films in order to understand the film itself. Myself, I haven&apos;t even watched any ordinary Bollywood film, but I&apos;ve watched some clips and heard of Yash Raj&apos;s other hits, so I understand.\n\nEver since the giant Hindi studio Yash Raj Films included a clip from &apos;Cars&apos; in &apos;Dhoom 2&apos; and used the Disney Store and a song provided by Disney (non-pop) in Ta Ra Rum Pum, Disney had decided to join forces with the studio to create Roadside Romeo. Before the film was developed, Indian animation looked pretty cheesy. But Tata Elxsi, a VFX studio responsible for doing VFX for plenty of Bollywood films and two of Marvel&apos;s films, did a pretty impressive job on making it almost Pixar quality. (I&apos;ve heard in the commentary that someone from Pixar came over to visit the creators and teach them how to do fur)\n\nAnyway, the film is about a spoiled, cute-looking, rich dog dude named Romeo (Saif Ali Khan) who gets abandoned on the streets of Mumbai, where he gets bullied and then befriended by a pack of strays with unique personalities. Guru is the leader of the pack. His name speaks everything about him. Hero English is a dog with a funny hairstyle, buckteeth and a bow-tie who wishes to actually speak full English, though a lot of the characters speak broken English and Hindi at the same time. His eyes and his buckteeth might make you think of Sid the Sloth from Ice Age. Interval is a big fan of YRF who copies many lines of the actors who have starred in their films. Mini is, believe it or not, a pretty aggressive alley cat, just about the only one in the movie, who thinks she is a stray dog and refuses to disbelieve it. Oh, and there&apos;s also a mouse who is kind of the Jerry type when it comes to enemies.\n\nTogether, Romeo and the strays start a salon after Romeo shows his haircutting skills just so they can get some business. One night, Romeo falls in love with a pretty female pooch named Laila (Kareena Kapoor) after hearing her sing and watching her dance. The next day, Romeo meets a ferocious, disgusting, big-lipped bulldog with a bit of an accent named Charlie Anna (Jaaved Jaffery), his sidekick Chhainu, who gets beaten up all the time and looks like Wile E. Coyote&apos;s long lost father, and his female ninja dogs, Charlie&apos;s Angels. Which set of girls do the Angels parody? Well, duh! Romeo and Charlie rival over Laila, much to the dismay of Romeo&apos;s friends. Who will win? Everyone knows the answer...\n\nI&apos;ve listened to one of the songs from the film everyday surprisingly. They&apos;re just so catchy! My most favourite song has to be &quot;Choo Le Na&quot;. The songs are better than the cheap pop songs Disney has to spew out today! ;) A few song sequences in this movie act like Indian music videos. You might see a character appearing in some random place while singing and dancing. The biggest example is in &quot;Cool Cool&quot;.\n\nThe creators acted quite like Pixar when doing this movie. Not only did they do impressive animation/motion capture inspired by that of Ratatouille, they also released teaser trailers without actual footage one year before the film was released. In the film itself, they managed to slip in some in-jokes of the Pixar tradition, including the name &quot;Tata&quot;, some posters of other Yash Raj films, photographs of YRF&apos;s actors/actresses and some Mickey Mouse references. Heck. they even added some bloopers in the credits! If only Pixar used them more often... Maybe on their DVDs.\n\nThough it ain&apos;t the best animated film of 2008, Roadside Romeo has plenty of charm and feel, including some tension, beautiful romantic moments (especially , and clever humour. It does have gross-out humour including flatulence, but there&apos;s one bit of it that actually made me laugh. At Charlie is the most appropriate victim! My big problem with the film was - did Yash Raj care about the audience of theirs that loves Disney and is not familiar with Bollywood? Still, there are some parts that kids would enjoy (Hindu kids, even), such as the little mouse&apos;s moments and the Looney Tunes style gags. But not all of it is kiddy. Poor Romeo gets strangled several times, for instance. Kids might not even be interested, to tell you the truth.

The first story, &quot;The Postman,&quot; is about a lower-middle-class bourgeois city boy who goes deep into the Bengali countryside to take a job as a village postman. The &quot;daughter&quot; in this story is Ratna (nicknamed &quot;Ratan&quot;), his servant, a little slip of a girl. In the west, this girl, an orphan, not even at the age of adolescence, is a child. How can she cope? What can she look forward to? The second story, &quot;Samapti,&quot; is about another girl in rural Bengal, this one a little older. She&apos;s what we would call a &quot;tomboy.&quot; The life of an adult woman in this society -- a housewife -- wouldn&apos;t seem to be much in her taste. She is active, vivacious, lively, brazen, playful. She is known as &quot;Pagli&quot; (&quot;crazy&quot;) by the disapproving villagers. But it is these very qualities that attract the attention of Amulya, a young college graduate who has returned home to his widowed mother to be nagged by her to settle down and take a wife -- a traditional, shy, modest, and, in Amulya&apos;s view, boring wife. Despite the serious subject of these two stories, they are actually quite funny. The second story is even hilarious, with a couple of near-slapstick sequences.

Even though I was a bit skeptical seeing that Kukunoor has been going downhill since &apos;Bombay to Bangkok&apos; and the casting of John Abraham in the lead role didn&apos;t sound very promising but I was wrong. &apos;Aashayein&apos; is a heartfelt down-to-earth little film about a young man who, after being diagnosed with cancer, admits himself to a hospice, leaving behind the life he once knew (that includes a fiancée), only to find a new one. The premise sounds familiar but don&apos;t be fooled. This isn&apos;t another &apos;Anand&apos; or &apos;Dasvidaniya&apos;. Yet, Kukunoor doesn&apos;t shy away from showing who he&apos;s influenced by as he wisely makes references to classics like &apos;Anand&apos; and &apos;Indiana Jones&apos;. The Indiana Jones dream sequences are quite well executed. The songs, including the Shreyas Talpade item number, fit in well.\n\nThe setting of the hospice is quite beautiful. Hindi films usually depict hospitals and other medical centres as this cold, impersonal place where the ill are ignored or treated without affection. Thankfully Kukunoor sheds a positive light and hopefully there are more such options for people in India. In addition, I also liked how Kukunoor briefly depicts the struggle encountered by the medical staff in order to run the place.\n\nJohn Abraham&apos;s performance may not be flawless but it&apos;s the best work he&apos;s done to date. Hot Sonal Sehgal has good screen presence. Girish Karnad, Prateeksha Lonkar and Farida Jalal provide great support. I would have liked to see more of the lovely Jalal as her character was very interesting. Finally, the star of &apos;Aashayein&apos; is Anaitha Nair who steals every scene she&apos;s in with a commendable performance. I would like to see more of this actress cast in such significant roles in good films.\n\n&apos;Aashayein&apos; may have its share of flaws but it manages to win the heart of the viewer and I hope, from this movie on, Kukunoor stays on track instead of stumbling with the likes of &apos;8 x 10 Tasveer&apos;.""},""aggregateRating""","[""Drama""]","""2010-08-27""","""cancer,lung cancer,ashram,hope,terminal cancer""","""2H""",12.0

After hearing Himesh Reshammiya&apos;s version of Ek Hasina Thi I was swayed and decided to give it a shot. The song had such a haunting quality and was frankly surprised by how good it was. Sadly the song is the only decent thing about this movie. \n\nHonestly I am surprised how Satish Kaushik could make such an amateur movie, I wouldn&apos;t expect this kind of movie from a film student let alone a veteran director. This movie is a failure in almost every department. Honestly it&apos;s worse than a B Grade movie.\n\nThe performances from the leads, Himesh and Shweta Kumar (daughter of director Indra Kumar) are two of the worst performances I have seen in any movie. Himesh somehow managed to bag a few more movies but Shweta only managed to star in her dad&apos;s Super Nani after this. Even seasoned pros like Urmila and Raj Babbar ham it up really badly. I was surprised at Urmila particularly because I thought she did well in the Ek Hasina Thi number, her expressions during the song were spot on. Although I never expected to measure upto Simi Garewal, I expected better from her. \n\nIt was embarrassing to see Gulshan Grover slumming it in a thankless role. \n\nSome very poor choices have been said throughout this movie, like for instance in the scene where Himesh goes to see Asrani to know the whereabouts of Ravi Verma&apos;s family and for some inexplicable reason mid conversation it shifts to a comedy track and then goes serious again. What should have been a good dramatic moment is ruined completely. \n\nAnother disappointment was that apart of Ek Hasina thi, there are no other good songs in this movie. \n\nGiven the classic status of the original, the people involved should at least have done a half decent job so that it does justice to the former. \n\nWhen Karzzz should have been thrilling and suspenseful, it evokes no other reaction for me other than sheer disdain for all the people involved in the making of this movie. \n\nSeeing the end result must have been a real slap in the face for Subhash Ghai and everyone else involved with the original. I would love to hear their reactions to the atrocity that is Karzzz. \n\nIn my opinion it is up there with such Hollywood atrocities like Batman and Robin and Superman 4","[""Action"",""Drama"",""Musical""]","""2008-10-17""","""one word title,vengeance,singer,rock star,revenge""","""2H22M""",14.0

Arth is the story of this women&apos;s search for her identity."",""","""Ghazal maestro Jagjit Singh has passed away. The world of Ghazals and Shaayari is mourning the sad demise of the one and only Jagjit Singh. Ghazal singing has never been a profession for him. He always took it as the worship of the Lord. His soulmate Chitra stopped singing after the demise of their the only son - Vivek in an accident in 1993 but Jagjit did not stop it. Can a devotee stop worshipping the Almighty in any condition ? No. Hence Jagjit Singh continued, suppressing and trying to forget the grief in his heart.\n\nJagjit Singh always sung from the heart. And he always chose Ghazals and Nazms of very high literary quality for singing. That&apos;s how he became instrumental in popularizing Ghazals as a form of light music. He sang for Bollywood movies too. The Ghazal, Nazm and songs of Saath Saath (1982) and the immortal love song - Hothon Se Chhoo Lo Tum (Prem Geet - 1981) are a few illustrations. However Mahesh Bhatt&apos;s Arth (1982) is different in the sense that Jagjit Singh not only sang the Ghazals and Nazms but he only composed their music also. The music director of Arth is none other than Jagjit Singh himself. Though he had composed the music of Prem Geet also, Arth is his unique contribution to Bollywood music because in addition to composing the music, he and his soulmate Chitra sang all the Ghazals and Nazms included in the movie and all are invaluable gems for the lovers of music and Shaayari. I pay my tribute to him through review of this movie which was considered quite bold at the time of its release.\n\nArth (meaning) is the story of extra-marital relationship of Inder (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) and Kavita (Smita Patil). Inder is married to Pooja (Shabaana Azmi). Inder leaves Pooja for the sake of mentally insecure and unstable Kavita but finally Kavita also discards him. Pooja is heartbroken whom Raj (Raj Kiran) tries to console through his love for her. However Pooja decides to search an identity for herself in the world, independent of the support of any male.\n\nMahesh Bhatt used to direct average movies prior to Arth (Manzilen Aur Bhi Hain, Lahu Ke Do Rang, Vishwasghaat etc.). Arth was a milestone in his directorial career after which he never looked back. He always blew the trumpet that Arth was inspired by his own life-story (Parveen Babi being the abnormal other woman in his life). Whether it has anything to do with his life or not, Arth is an admirable movie. A good story was taken and the climax made the announcement of the true woman-lib, i.e., liberation from the shackles of dependence on men.\n\nArth boasts of power-packed performances of all the three principal actors - Shabaana Aazmi, Smita Patil and Kulbhushan Kharbanda. I won&apos;t try to show lamp to the sun by saying anything about the leading ladies who were the pillars of the parallel cinema movement of the seventies and the eighties. However I say about Kulbhushan Kharbanda that it is definitely one of the best ever performances of this underrated actor.\n\nBut the trouble lies in the fact that Mahesh Bhatt painted all these three characters with very thick colours. So thick that they lost their naturalness and turned from flesh and blood human-beings to lifeless portraits on the canvas. Mahesh Bhatt could not restrain himself in certain matters and went for exaggeration. And his over-enthusiasm did not allow the movie to become a classic or a masterpiece. What Kavita realized later (that when Inder could leave Pooja for her, he could leave her too for someone else), could have been (and should have been) realized by her earlier too. Inder returns back to Pooja (after he has been discarded by Kavita) like a beggar. It does not match his basic Character.\n\nRaj Kiran as the Ghazal singer has performed even better than the main threesome and he has impressed the most because his character has not lost its natural flavour like the other three. His performance in the song - Tum Itna Jo Muskura Rahe Ho is simply lovable. That&apos;s why Shabaana&apos;s refusing his love in the end does not appeal to the audience because independence from men does not mean a life devoid of love.\n\nOther than Raj Kiran, the other supporting characters also performed very well. And it&apos;s the performance of the supporting cast which elevated the movie by a few notches. The performance of Rohini Hattangadi as the maid of Pooja deserves special mention.\n\nUltimately, it&apos;s the music composed by Jagjit Singh, using the Shaayari of Shabaana&apos;s father and the great Shaayar - Janaab Kaifi Aazmi which makes this movie an unforgettable one. You can forget the movie, not its songs. Whether it&apos;s the Ghazals - Tum Itna Jo Muskura Rahe Ho and Jhuki Jhuki Si Nazar Beqaraar Hai Ki Nahin (both sung by Jagjit Singh himself) and Tu Nahi To Zindagi Mein Aur Kya Reh Jaayega (sung by Chitra Singh) or it&apos;s the heart-piercing Nazms - Koi Ye Kaise Bataaye and Tere Khushboo Mein Base Khat Main Jalaata Kaise, every piece is enchanting for the listener. Jagjit himself sung the songs because no other voice could do justice to the lyric and the composition. Ghazal word has been derived from Ghazala (female deer) and the painful sound coming from its throat is known as Ghazal. And that&apos;s why the true Ghazal singer is one who is able to convey the Soz (pain) inherent in the words. Jagjit Singh with his God-given voice perfectly suiting Ghazals and Nazms, only could do it as far as the songs of Arth are concerned. The music of this movie is an invaluable jewel in the treasure of Bollywood music.\n\nI recommend this sentimental movie with a strong message to the people interested in watching meaningful cinema.""},""aggregateRating""","[""Drama"",""Romance""]","""1982-12-03""","""letter of resignation,actress,extramarital affair,tearjerker,insecurity""","""2H18M""",40.0

Just put in few hot scenes with romantic songs and people will merrily watch the film with their mouths open? Forget about horror, this film glorifies the cheap mentality of Indian film makers. In fact I am the biggest fool to waste my time on these crap films. Horror genre is losing its hold day by day not only in Bollywood but also in Hollywood. I know it is difficult to bring up an entirely original horror story these days, but at least deliver a few scares (even jump scares would do).\n\nHere a writer Kabir (Habib Faisal) goes into the wilderness of Jammu to write a novel. No prize for guessing that he stays in a creepy lakeside lodge. The lodge is managed by a single woman Meera (Sapna Pabbi) whose husband Jaidev(Gurmeet Chaudhary) is ill. Soon our writer starts experiencing spooky activities like seeing scary reflections in glass, opening doors, etc. which were more comedy than scary. The wheels wear off even before the ride begins. The suspense and reveal behind the scary events was hilarious. Actually number of times I laughed at the scary moments is more than the number of times I was scared. Not a single moment was scary. By the time we reached the climax ridiculed with pathetic CGI and absurd ho-hums I was least bothered.\n\nWith forced romance and songs (a few good ones thanks to Arijit Singh), Khamoshiyan is just another horrex film of Bollywood which I should not have bothered to watch. After the horrendous &apos;Alone&apos; just a few weeks ago, we have another one in the same month.

However, this irks their jobless husbands who can go to extreme lengths to stop them."",""","""K. Raghavendra Rao comes up with a comedy with a social message. What I dislike about most of Rao&apos;s films is that their execution is poorly done and outdated and their movies seem to be set during the stone ages (not literally) while the story is melodramatic as it can get. &apos;Aamdani Atthanni Kharcha Rupaiya&apos; is not an exception in most cases except that it&apos;s set in a slightly more modern city rather than a retarded village from the 1980s. But, unlike their other films, this one is NOT a lost case because of the actors and the comedy.\n\n&apos;Aamdani Atthanni Kharcha Rupaiya&apos; presents relevant themes such as sexism, female emancipation etc. I liked that the story revolved around three wives trying to get a job while their sexist husbands strongly oppose this in fear of losing their manhood. India is modernizing more by each passing year but such things do remain a problem within some parts of the culture. The problem in the film is that things are a over-the-top and the characters aren&apos;t very well written. Himesh Reshammiya&apos;s music is forgettable.\n\nThe comedic situations are hilarious (while the dramatic ones are overtly melodramatic) and the actors mostly do a great job. Juhi Chawla and Ketki Dave steal the show with their natural comedic abilities. Asrani is great as the sympathetic film buff boss. Govinda too is likable. He and Juhi are great as the ideal neighbour. I would have liked to see Tabu do more comedy but she&apos;s stuck with a serious role of which she does nothing short of a decent job. Even Johnny Lever (whom I find intolerable in almost every other movie) is enjoyable (though his character is hateful). A relative newcomer Isha Koppikar has a refreshing screen presence and holds her own while Chandrachur Singh and Vinay Anand are quite annoying.\n\nThus, to conclude, &apos;Aamdani Atthanni Kharcha Rupaiya&apos; can be said to be one of the better Rao films simply for it&apos;s laugh-out-loud moments thanks mostly to the talented cast (with the exception of some of those mentioned above).""},""aggregateRating""","[""Comedy"",""Drama"",""Family""]","""2001-12-21""","""fight,remake,deception,husband wife relationship,dysfunctional family""","""2H30M""",21.0

This is also one of the better works of the director, Partho Ghosh. The movie has a great deal of emotions and touches the viewer at many places. It not only entertains, but also gives good messages of communal unity and crime never pays.\n\nAs the name suggests, the story belongs to Ghulam-e-Mustafa (originally the name of the movie was kept Mustafa but due to opposition of certain religious groups, it was changed to Ghulam-e-Mustafa) who is the henchman and right hand of Saanta Prasad (known as Abba among his man and in the underworld). Abba had adopted and fostered him and hence he feels himself indebted to him for life, doing anything he wants Mustafa to do without giving any thought to its propriety or ethicality. He comes in contact with a teacher Kavita who loves him to the extent of becoming his wife despite knowing everything about his past, present and of course, future, without any regrets. But when she is killed in an attempt on Mustafa&apos;s life by his enemies (say the enemies of Abba), Mustafa&apos;s profound grief proves to be an eye-opener for him. He realises that the violence in which he has been involved for years in the name of Abba&apos;s work considering it as his duty, is nothing more than an outright futile and condemnable phenomena which has made him guilty of taking innocent lives. The pain of losing his beloved make him empathise with the pain of his own victims. A thoroughly changed Mustafa leaves the path of violence and Abba&apos;s house too. Abba loves him so much that he realises his pain and consequential change in him and therefore let him go his new way. Mustafa now finds his way leading to the house of Dayanand Dixit, an honest govt. officer, unreasonably trapped by an anti-corruption officer and sentenced to imprisonment resulting in the plight of his family containing his wife, son and daughter. Mustafa enters the pain-stricken house of this Hindu Brahman family as a trespasser and imposes himself upon the family members who initially hate him but with the passage of time come to realise that he has come to their house to play the messiah for them. He saves them from all their enemies including the corrupt anti-corruption officer who has his lustful eye on Dixit&apos;s daughter. However the main problem is monetary hardship and the honour of the family. He gets an opportunity to solve this problem by making a deal with Abba who wants the services of his beloved ex-henchman back to reap the electoral harvest by unlawful means for a particular political party. Mustafa agrees to do the wrong thing for the last time in his life in lieu of release of Dixit from jail and his exoneration from the false charges levied upon him as well as a job for Dixit&apos;s son and monetary help for his daughter&apos;s marriage. However he conveys in good faith to Abba that he will surrender to the authorities for his past crimes after the objectives of Abba as well as himself are fulfilled. This communication leads to the unexpected climax of the movie when Mustafa is shot dead by his loving Abba himself to prevent him from arrest and abolish any possibility of exposure of Abba and the politician, Abba is working for.\n\nGhulam-e-Mustafa is a movie in which Nana Patekar shows the depth of his acting talent in the simplest manner. He is an actor par excellence and Ghulam-e-Mustafa demonstrates why he has such a huge fan-following. Raveena Tandon as Kavita is very charming and impressive. She has done a good job despite less footage given to her. The support cast has also done excellently including the villains. Paresh Rawal has acted a difficult character of Nana&apos;s mentor who loves him by heart but compelled to eliminate him due to his illegal profession&apos;s requirements, proving once more that he is a highly versatile actor who can infuse life in any type of positive or negative character. In Ghulam-e-Mustafa, Paresh&apos;s character is neither positive nor fully negative, it is a character with grey shades whose activities are apparently contradictory, yet quite logical. Among other cast, special mention is needed for Shivaji Satam as Dayanand Dixit and Aruna Irani as his wife, Bhagyalakshmi Dixit who have acted their roles with the highest level of sensitivity naturality.\n\nThe music is not great but very touchy. The songs may not have been chartbusters but their melody and meaningfulness can be easily felt while listening. Lovers of emotional songs should definitely listen to &apos;Tera Gham, Mera Gham, Ek Jaisa Sanam&apos;. The other aspects of production are also satisfactory. The storyteller has been successful in keeping the viewers glued to their seats throughout the movie and he never lets them down at any point during the narration. Many scenes compel the viewers to clap. Mustafa&apos;s refusing the non-vegetarian food sent for him by Abba to respect the sentiments of the Dixit family is an example.\n\nMovies like Ghulam-e-Mustafa are like an oasis in desert in these times of communal hatred and biases. Ghulam-e-Mustafa had come much prior to the fateful 9/11. However it&apos;s relevance can be felt when watched today. The movie carries both the entertainment value and the inspirational value in good quantum. It shows that anybody can be a good human-being or become a good human""},""aggregateRating""", , , ,"""2H42M""",25.0

I usually reserve that for &quot;So bad it&apos;s good&quot; films. Mujhe Kucch Kehna Hai is no exception. Although it&apos;s clearly a comedy at times, it&apos;s just as often funny when it&apos;s not supposed to be--both the comedy and the serious bits are frequently ridiculous. That makes it a lot of fun to watch, but it&apos;s not exactly a good film.\n\nThe plot, in a nutshell (a nutshell is really all there is to it), features Karan (Tusshar Kapoor) trying to find and court Pooja Saxena (Kareena Kapoor--she and Tusshar are not related as far as I know; they at least do not seem to be closely related). Karan happened to see Pooja from a distance and instantly fell in love with her. They keep having close encounters, but something always interrupts, and in a typical Bollywood move, Karan never musters the courage to initiate anything other than polite, casual conversation. Karan lives in a moderately sized Indian town. Pooja is from the States, visiting relatives to do research on &quot;Indian culture&quot;, and trying to get accepted into Harvard. Karan is much less scholarly. He has a cadre of relatively goofy friends, they have a band, and we learn that he can fight unbelievably well.\n\nThe idea of the plot isn&apos;t horrible, even if it is simplistic. Mujhe Kucch Kehna Hai is basically a series of misadventures. The problems with the plot arise in the way director Satish Kaushik and writers Rumi Jaffrey and Karunakar handle it. For the first half-hour, they&apos;re basically just treading water. Kareena Kapoor doesn&apos;t appear until the 35-minute mark. We have a fifth of a typically overlong film just to introduce characters, in absence of any real story. Further, because of the simplicity and the necessity of increasing the severity of the misadventures, and also related to length, we have a film that peaks at least 40 minutes before it is over. Like too many Bollywood films, this story would have played much better if kept to 90 minutes. On the positive side, the ending is refreshingly unusual. Kaushik and crew avoid simply resorting to clichés.\n\nBut there are bigger problems with Mujhe Kucch Kehna Hai than the plot. Kareena Kapoor, although more than pleasant to look at, consistently comes across as if she thinks she&apos;s doing a shampoo commercial rather than a dramatic film. She constantly &quot;glamour mugs&quot; in an exaggerated way, and she&apos;s regularly flipping and bouncing her hair around (her first scene, where she&apos;s bouncing up and down and showing off her decorated hands, is particularly funny for its absurdity). This was one of her earlier films, so maybe the ridiculous and ill-suited overacting is more excusable, but that makes it no less unintentionally funny to watch. Admittedly, her acting has improved rapidly. She didn&apos;t seem so out of place in Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon (2003), although on the other hand, that film is absurdly cartoonish at times.\n\nTusshar Kapoor comes across as the better actor here, even though this was his first film. But as decent as he is, Kaushik and crew have him and the rest of the cast doing ridiculous things. The bits that are supposed to be comic--like Karan&apos;s daydreaming leading to him using his friend as a guitar--are okay for their ridiculousness. To be funny, there has to be something &quot;out of place&quot;, roughly. But a number of scenes that are supposed to be climactically dramatic--such as an attempted rescue from a cliff, or Karan&apos;s proposed and actual birthday presents to Pooja, end up being just as funny.\n\nKaushik also stages a couple absurd fight scenes, with random &quot;striking&quot; sound effects that reminded me of the hilarious fight scenes in Mudda (2003). For my tastes, there was also an overabundance of songs, which featured way too much &quot;look how young and hip we are&quot; mugging, some very fake musicianship from our stars (doesn&apos;t any member of an Indian film crew know how to set up a drumset?), and some very &quot;flamboyant&quot; dancing and posing from some of the male back-up dancers. Of course, the typical travelogue cinematography accompanies most of the love songs. Much of the Mujhe Kucch Kehna Hai was filmed in New Zealand, and Kaushik does a good job of exploiting the setting, even if that means prominent appearances of businesses such as McDonald&apos;s and Burger King. No one involved with this film is reluctant to show their immersion in popular western youth culture, even though it usually comes across as more goofy (and occasionally behind the times--just check out the preppy shoulder sweater) than anything else. The first scene is in a disco, with a crowd dancing to &quot;Who let the Dogs Out&quot;, before Balram Singh (Amrish Puri) begins his constant utterances of &quot;very good, very very good&quot;, as he has a group of girls &quot;rate&quot; boys he parades across the stage. That gives you a good taste of what is in store for the length of the film.\n\nIf you do not speak Hindi, you&apos;re in for a bit of an extra challenge with Mujhe Kucch Kehna Hai, as much of the dialogue moves by very quickly, resulting in subtitles that disappear quicker than you can read them. There are more lines than usual that remain untranslated, and for some reason, they just didn&apos;t bother to translate the lyrics to the songs at all.\n\nIf you&apos;re in the mood for some silly humor, both intentional and unintentional, this is worth a watch. You&apos;ll laugh at the film as often as you laugh with it. Just don&apos;t use this film to introduce any of your friends to Bollywood."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama"",""Romance""]","""2001-05-25""","""nightclub,dream,mother son relationship,love letter,slacker""","""2H15M""",21.0

That a fictitious country called Bangistan is torn between communal tension is a good base to make a satire. But the wagon which was supposed to hit the star looks like it has punctured all its tires, burst all its windows and windshield, and has swerved off road into a known yet unpleasant territory that is best described as moronic and highfalutin. Known, because this territory is already crowded with the Bollywood likes (Roy (2015), et al). Unpleasant, because, well, you know.\n\nTwo over-smart and over-sympathetic characters (Samrat &amp; Deshmukh) are sent by their respective community leaders to Poland (for heck&apos;s sake) of Hindi speaking yet Polish lipping inhabitants to carry out a suicide bombing mission in an attempt to instigate international terror thereby disrupting harmony. Dialogs have been stolen from classic films, and if you were to subtract the steal from the total dialogs in the film, you will have a non-operational womb in your hand.\n\nThe biggest problem with the film is that its comedy is all single- layered, meaning a joke is introduced and is taken forward until it transforms into farce (and travesty) and into hogwash and then finally spirals into an abyss of dark nothingness. Editing and direction are in gutters, and so is the pretentious screenplay. \n\nBasically, the whole film is Mr Anshuman&apos;s imagination, and when one imagines things, success is always a presumed by-product. Unfortunately, nothing works in reality; not even those indigenously made explosives that they use in the film. The songs ignite trepidation in its viewers and the music man is growling his way to get noticed. We get it, Mr Sampat, you can scream.\n\nThere is not an iota of sense in the film which could grip the audience, forget about hooking them. There is no insight into the actual theme of the film and with that sermon at the end, all goes downhill. The protagonists or the antagonists or the anti-heroes (it&apos;s all messed up) suddenly stop and introspect about their foolish actions and then we have a genre shift in the film, which is more unbearable than what preceded.\n\nWhile Deshmukh looks confused, Samrat is the epitome of overacting. I checked my phone for three seconds and my neighbor notified me that I had missed Miss Fernandez. I was happier.\n\nThe plot holes are in millions, plus during a fight scene towards the end, all limits are crossed and one realizes that these two hours will never come back. The background score tries hard like a mother tries hard to teach her son to carve out a perfect cursive letter &quot;f,&quot; but the result is a garbled product which looks like a pile of crap. And the whole drama ends with tears. Trust me, there will be tears. River of tears in the situation room of Excel Entertainment. For cryin&apos; out loud, the expectations were higher because of Akhtar and Sidhwani on board, however the man at the wheel goes super retard.\n\nWhen a rookie filmmaker uses Mozart&apos;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; to weigh in the magnitude of a scene, one ought to know that there is nothing much to consider in the film. In the case of Bangistan, why don&apos;t you skip the word &quot;much&quot; from the previous statement? Ironically, to imagine that if the director was to again don the cap of a film critic one last time and review his own movie, the river of tears that I was talking about would turn into an ocean, all thanks to Mr Anshuman.\n\nBOTTOM LINE","[""Comedy"",""Drama""]","""2015-08-07""","""mission""","""2H15M""",7.0

Maybe it was a flashback of the main character as a kid... but it seems that would only make sense if the lead character was 30yrs old.\n\nI tried to give this movie a chance. But there were just too many things that bugged me... The writing for instance, all the graffiti terminology was incorrectly used. When a graffiti writer goes &quot;Bombing&quot; he does not go out and do full illegal murals. Nobody even mentions doing &quot;fill-ins&quot; or &quot;throwups&quot; which are the most commonly used terms/acts by graf-writers. They call them &quot;pieces&quot; in the movie, which is completely wrong. Those are just some examples...\n\nIt became pretty obvious that the filmmakers knew little or Nothing about graffiti. Just because you know about Sane &amp; Smith, and heard a couple chase stories from your NYU buddy, isn&apos;t enough to go out and make a significant Graffiti movie. There is some &quot;cool&quot; cinematography in this, which isn&apos;t bad. But that&apos;s it. Storyline is similar to the likes of Wild Style or Beat Street (a hip hop love story). But even those movies were made with less pretension than this."",""reviewRating""", , , ,"""1H31M""",20.0

This assertion gave me the impression that the movie would be replete with verbal wars between the contesting advocates in the court. However when I rented the movie to verify the claim, it had a little legal war, and that too was a bit stereotypical. The movie, however, had its other rewards to offer. A simple, no-nonsense plot about the woes of the family of a wrongly executed man, this film for the most part matches the reaction to the action with minimal overacting. The culminating scene wherein Anil Kapoor, apart from rescuing his mother, gives vent to his pent up feelings of righteous anguish and indignation against the vile acts of Amreesh Puri due to which he had to lead all his life in bitterness -- physical and mental -- is the highlight of the movie in my opinion. In this emotional tirade, we the viewers, have emotions exactly like a person would have, who has been victimised thus. This sympathy of emotions is the biggest achievement of this film.

And on the other an amateurish product like FUGLY gets produced by a big star (Akshay) and also gets promoted through a special video song featuring both Akshay Kumar and Salman Khan. Now thinking about the two, either they both agreed to do this particular venture to oblige someone close or perhaps the big names don&apos;t even have the time (or intentions) to check what kind of product they are promoting through such exceptional strategy at a decent cost.\n\nHonestly, these were my thoughts while watching FUGLY just after its first hour and the film is a big disappointment both for the viewers as well as for the newcomers expecting a lot from the same. Taking huge inspirations from films like PAANCH, SHAITAAN, FUKREY and RANG DE BASANTI, its based on a script mixing them all and then coming up with a tasteless cocktail which neither offers any fun, thrills or entertainment in its two long hours full of many dumb scenes. The forced slang of the Delhi lingo remains bad throughout and the ridiculous story progression trying to incorporate everything ranging from friendship, eve-teasing, drugs, corrupt police, politics &amp; channel reporters to patriotism, sacrifice and leadership simply falls flat, impressing none. Moreover the silly climax even makes you laugh looking at the desperation shown by the writers in a foolish hospital sequence.\n\nDirected by Kabir Sadanand, FUGLY had everything required to make a decent film. But the team simply wasted this given opportunity despite having a justified budget and two big stars backing them from the front. The project does catch your attention with a fine cinematography but few mediocre songs, loud background score, weak performances and a pretty messy narrative in the second half completely ruin the sufficient resources provided.\n\nTo be fair with the fresh cast, though they still have a lot to learn but I would not like to blame them at all because its actually the writing, dialogues and stupid sequences in the film, which make them look more childish than they actually are. Out of the four,Mohit Marwah &amp; Vijender Singh try too hard with their limited ability, Arif Lamba has got nothing to convey and only Kiara Advani gives you something to watch, but that too only because of her good looks and revealing outfits. So in the performance department you only have Jimmy Shergill saving the film with his convincing act of a corrupt Haryanvi Police officer and an old lady along with Vijender&apos;s young politician uncle who thankfully provide the only amusing moments in this otherwise dull film called FUGLY.\n\nInterestingly the strange and rather unusual title FUGLY (reportedly) means FIGHT with the UGLY or F@#$ the UGLY in the society around. However, the end product is not even close to any of the good intentions visible in this newly invented word and here is the description of its five highly absurd scenes, which would clearly give you an idea about the film and its avoidable content perfectly.\n\nA. It opens with one of the boys setting himself to fire right in front of the India Gate and after getting burned badly is being taken to the hospital in a stretcher. Now just outside the hospital, as he is brought out of the ambulance, a whole group of reporters put their mike right in front of his face and start asking him questions like, &quot;Why did you opt for this? What is the motive? How are you feeling now?&quot;\n\nAnd for me this was really a dumb start of a film, undoubtedly!\n\nB. In one of its supposed to be funny scenes, Vijender Singh pulls down an American flag from one of the street poles and then wears it around his waist. On being asked that what he will do with it, he says, &quot;I will make my boxers (nickers) from this.&quot;\n\nSo if its your own country&apos;s flag then it is disrespectful &amp; a crime to treat it like this. But in case it belongs to another country then its fine to insult it in anyway and that too by a national sportsman having won international fame! Ironically they have used this particular scene in the film&apos;s promos too but I really didn&apos;t expect this from Vijender frankly!\n\nC. In one of its sequences talking about eve-teasing, the girl says, &quot;Main Delhi Li Ladki Hoon! Dhakke Aur Ragarh Ka Fark Jaanti Hoon!&quot; – And that was some great writing indeed!\n\nD. A vague subplot in the film shows that anyone can arrange a hidden drug party in the outskirts of Delhi at a farmhouse and can earn 30-40 lakhs just like that in a single night as if it was that easy like organizing a wedding event by a professional planner in routine.\n\nE. Lastly the most hilarious one comes in the climax, when a more than 60% burnt person lying on a hospital bed, suddenly jumps on to the Inspector and tries to strangle him with the oxygen pipes around, using his full strength like a normal youngster.\n\nNow I have certainly heard about cinematic liberty but this was really like considering the viewers as a bunch of fools.\n\nTo sum up, if you still wish to watch FUGLY which actually remains UGLY, then watch it spending nothing when it gets aired on a TV channel soon and not before that."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama"",""Thriller""]","""2014-06-13""","""murder""","""2H14M""",8.0

The difference is that Vijay is doing it on his own and, Sunil for Uncle (Kader Khan) an enemy of Bittoo&apos;s father. To help their own cause, Ram and Laxman lure two teachers Anju (Parveen Babi) and Shalu (Hema Malini), respectively in their web of love. What ensues from here is a hilarious comedy of one-up-man-ship, Ram and Laxman trying to outwit each other.\n\nWhat makes Do Aur Do Paanch different from other comedy movies is that unlike other comedies where there is usually one or two main supporting comedian, there is no comedian in it (unless you want to rank Amitabh and Shashi along comedians). The element of comic is in the story telling, script, dialogs and acting. Moreover, the comedy is spontaneous and is not forced upon the audience.\n\nAmitabh and Shashi who have proved their chemistry in earlier movies excel in this movie with their first rate acting and dialog delivery timing. Hema Malini and Parveen Babi as love interests of Shashi and Amitabh have supported ably with their acting skills. Kader Khan has little screen presence but leaves a lasting impression as villain &quot;Uncle&quot; (a different flavor of villain). There is menace in his role but at the same time his acting, dialog delivery and timing evokes laughter. Not to forget is Bittoo the child artist who has acted very well and is the heart of the movie. The list of supporting cast is huge but all of them have acted well. It is necessary to mention that in this huge cast and spectra of talented actors Amitabh stands tall through his superior acting skills.\n\nRajesh Roshan&apos;s music composition is first rate. So are the words of lyricist Anjaan. All the songs are melodious and play-it-again kind. In songs &quot;Mere Zindagi Ne Mujhpe Ehsaan Kyaa Kiya Hai&quot;, &quot;Do Aur Do Paanch&quot;, &quot;Chhoti Hai Raat&quot;, and a small portion of &quot;Prem Se Humko Zine Do&quot; Kishore is simply at his best. The song &quot;Yeh Zulfon Ki Bhikri Ghatta Kya Kahti Hai (Kya Kahti Hai)&quot; rendered by Asha Bhonsle is soothing and pleasing to ear. In &quot;Prem Se Humho Zine Do&quot; Lata shows her versatility. The surprise package is Mehmood&apos;s magical rendering of part two of the &quot;Prem Se Humko Zine Do&quot;, and Rajesh Roshan rendering part two of &quot;Do Aur Do Paanch&quot;. Furthermore, the background score is noticeable and pleasant.\n\nRakesh Kumar&apos;s direction is good. His direction and the script makes sure the characters of the supporting cast is memorable. For instance, Goga Kapoor has only like six scenes but he will be remembered for the beating he (Lion) gets from two donkeys in &quot;Prem Se Humko Zine Do&quot;. Also, memorable are the cameo appearances of Om Prakash and Jagdeep. Credit also goes to the writing department (story, script, and dialogs) for giving us such a hilarious movie. Do Aur Do Paanch story has some not so apparent flaws but fast paced, linear and to the point (even when the heroes are with their heroines) story telling keeps the audience attention engaged till the end of movie and, away from the flaws.\n\nDo Aur Do Paanch is a collectible movie. To say it again, one never gets enough of it even after several viewings."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Comedy"",""Drama""]","""1980-02-08""","""uncle,boarding school,boy,burglar,rival""","""2H12M""",42.0

The good thing about the movie is the main storyline, which is new to the bollywood and has the potential to make the drama interesting till end. Ray (Neil Mukesh) got his hands on a camera, which can forecast future. He uses the camera to earn money. Troubles started when he becomes greedy. Eventually bad guys find out about the camera and wants to gain it at any cost. It is the duty of Ray now to keep the camera away from bad guys, and also saving his and his girlfriend Simi&apos;s (Bipasha Basu) life. Though the narration and the speed is good somehow the movie doesn&apos;t make a strong impact. At the end the moral of the story is don&apos;t be greedy. Screenplay, scripts, direction and actings should have been better. Some characters (lady agent played by Sophiya) are totally wasted and some scenes (Malaysian thieves capturing the couple) are totally useless. Also the car chase and the over all action fails to impress. These and some other facts helps killing the spirit of the movie. At the end everything is goodi goodi and everyone is happy. Not many songs in the movie, but still the music makes a good impact. Also some small concepts like blank photo were used nicely. Not much romance drama and not having any unnecessary parallel story line are some more good points. Over and all not a bad movie to watch if to be watched for free.

Some are of great importance and some are casual, some may prove right while same may lead to a disaster.

Not sure whether the man standing in front of him, whom he chased so long is the actual gangster he is looking for. And a prompt choice has to be made either to shoot and kill or try to persuade him to surrender. And the entire film is upon the thought process of the consequences of either of the choice made.

But one who takes the decision should also have guts to face the consequences. Need of the time is the biggest factor that influences our decision making ability and the course of action. Whatever one feels right is the correct choice for the time being, no matter what the consequences are.\n\nHuman race has transformed from primitive man to a socialised and civilised man today.

Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bhaduri&apos;s production company ABCL was ready to launch the movie while Indra Kumar was to direct. The original cast included Aamir Khan, Madhuri Dixit and Juhi Chawla. However, after ABCL fell apart, the film got shelved. Years later Indra Kumar tries to revive the film with a new cast that included Anil Kapoor, Aishwarya Rai and Preity Zinta but after the two actresses walked out they were respectively replaced by Karishma Kapoor and Shilpa Shetty. So, that&apos;s the history. Now what&apos;s the end product like? &apos;Rishtey&apos; is a pathetic excuse of a movie. The writing is so dreadful. The plot is one of those old fashioned crap about a stupid couple separating due to a misunderstanding created by the girl&apos;s father. There&apos;s a baby involved and after 10 years or whatever the mom finds out that the baby is alive and wants him back. In the end they live happily ever after, yes, even with the evil father who becomes a good guy after his daughter slaps him across the face and whatever. Indra Kumar is a terrible director. I think his earlier films were more watchable because of the actors and the music. Here all the songs (with the exception of &apos;Deewana Dil&apos;) are garbage. The best song in the soundtrack (&apos;Dilbar&apos; sung by the sensational Asha Bhosle) wasn&apos;t even in the movie.\n\nThe acting is clichéd and ridiculous to the core (with one exception). Anil Kapoor is miscast and, he whines, he barks, cries like a schoolgirl, is too old for the part, looks pathetic with the &apos;hey look I&apos;m young&apos; getup, and whatever. Karishma Kapoor is the queen of hamming. Though I must add that her character was awfully written. Deepshika and Sharat Saxena play clichéd characters that give them no scope and Amrish Puri&apos;s caricature evil dad is nothing memorable. Jibraan Khan is irritating.\n\nThe only good acting, and the only good thing that comes out of this heap of rubbish is Shilpa Shetty. Yes, she looks very sensual but if one can see past that, we do see a character with depth. The character does mildly suffer due to writing and the clichéd dialogues but Shetty moves ahead of that. She displays some impeccable comic timing and is wonderful in the dramatic sequences. One can only feel sympathy for her Vyjanti who is an uneducated fisherwoman hopelessly falling in love (as the definition of love is vague to her) with someone who does not give a damn. She selflessly does all she can to reunite Suraj with Komal knowing that there&apos;s nothing to gain and I was moved by the last scene where Karan looks at her and we see her eyes filled with tears of both joy and sadness as she signals him to not say anything.\n\nSo that&apos;s about it.

MIRCH was definitely one of those few under-estimated films which not only surprised me with its bold content but also made me think several times about all the relevant questions raised in its thought provoking script, after a long time.\n\nBut before praising the movie further, I would first like to mention that MIRCH is not at all a technically brilliant film from any angle nor it can be included in the list of all those perfectly acted or directed films either, to be precise. Yet, the reason why I am including it in my MUST SEE MOVIES List is that it is a very rare movie which is both likable as well as hateful in a very strange manner.\n\nIn fact MIRCH is a novel kind of daring attempt which at one end surely entertains you in a very fresh and mesmerizing style, but on the other hand it may also seriously offend both the MALE and FEMALE genders equally in a very dishonorable way. Talking about four different stories on the sexual relationship between man and women in contrasting backgrounds, the film is a pretty bold sex comedy which strictly calls for an adult viewing without any doubt. And in the end it may also turn out to be a dangerous movie putting many new unwanted ideas into your mind un-necessarily.\n\nIn short, its a Vinay Shukla directed film made on a very bold sexual subject, which for the first time explores the topic of adultery from the woman&apos;s side. In all the four stories in the film, it&apos;s the woman who betrays and cheats her husband in a very harsh way, whereas its only the fourth one in which the husband too is doing the similar kind of act on the other side. In each act of betrayal shown in the film, the women play on a certain trick and get away with their disrespectful act very smartly. On a controversial note, even after being a fairly entertaining flick, the film may come out to be both confusing and disturbing for a certain section of viewers who may like to take the depiction of Man and Women in its stories in a bad taste.\n\nWhere the women might feel being shown with an intolerably sickening attitude, the men too might feel being portrayed as fools and silly husbands on the screen with a pinch of humor. But at the same time, both the genders would also feel thoroughly entertained deep inside from their heart (which they may choose to hide). And that&apos;s actually what I liked the best about MIRCH, a movie which can generate such wide diverse reactions among the viewers which may go beyond any imagination of human mind.\n\nIn bold words, the film may be thought provoking for some and a kind of soft porn for many. It may be enlightening experience for one and a disgusting thought of a pervert mind for the other. It may seem to be a journey into the mind of woman for one and might turn out to be a waste of time for the other. And since there are not many movies which are capable of generating such variety of responses in the viewers, MIRCH becomes an important film to be seen and studied in your own unique way. \n\nHere I would also like to add that in spite of being based on such bold subject, the seducing and intimate scenes in the film never go beyond a certain limit and remain un-objectionable, which indeed is a great job done by the director and his cinematographer.\n\nReportedly the film is partly inspired from the Italian Classic &quot;The Decameron&quot; by Giovanni Boccaccio and partly from &quot;Panchtantra&quot; as mentioned in the movie itself. However, I was quite surprised with the reference of &quot;Panchtantra&quot; in it, because I only had a vision of &apos;Panchtantra&apos; as a collection of moral stories for the young ones. May be I would have to research on it a little more. Anyway, along with its interesting concept, director Vinay Shukla uses his entire talented star-cast in an intelligent way where no one looks like doing something wrong on the screen and also entertains. It only takes few initial moments to move into the actual theme of the movie and then it starts making its impact pretty fast.\n\nOn the whole, MIRCH is a movie which should be seen by all as a must because one cannot guess what actually you will make out of it in the end. After watching it, you may get a feeling close to the one mentioned above or in other case, you might go on to discover something of your own in the four stories unfolding on the screen one by one. But you essentially got to see it first to make your own decision."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Drama"",""Fantasy""]","""2010-10-22""","""female removes her clothes,film producer,prostitute,lust,adulterous husband""","""1H45M""",12.0

When Surya&apos;s young wife finds out about his affair with Lakshmi, they all find themselves at crossroads."",""","""Ankur is literally one the best Indian movies I have ever seen  actually, it ranks as one of my most favorite films of all time. There is something to be said about the Indian Film Industry  while it has altogether crumbled and become wildly glamorous and crass, many of the Indian movies since the advent of cinema and up until the early eighties were stupendous, thought provoking, and wholly a testament to the power of film.\n\nAnkur takes place in rural Andhra Pradesh, where a young man fights his father&apos;s wishes to run the family farm. He loses the battle, as all good boys would, gets married, and takes up agrarian life. His switch to that lifestyle is jarring, and he becomes rapidly bitter and enraged  essentially greed takes a hold of him, and he is unable to control himself in many respects. The story continues, largely focused on his housekeeper, Lakshmi (Azmi), and his relationship with her and the surrounding townspeople. His seemingly consistent life of exerting semi-torture and quasi-love for those he encounters is turned upside down when his wife finally arrives.\n\nThe character of Lakshmi  an young, largely oppressed by still happy worker is not at all unlike the realities of life in India (especially at that time). Benegal uses her exceptional beauty as a sort of scaffold for the viewer  not only are we sympathetic to her social predicament, but we are because of who she is, her kind words and fidelity.\n\nThe most powerful aspect of the film is the director&apos;s play on family dynamic, caste, and power. These themes are so interwoven and densely packed into the film, that it is hard to imagine it all coalescing so beautifully in just under two hours. Benegal&apos;s films, sometimes noted in the Indian &apos;New Wave&apos; movement, are generally as such. There is no doubt that this movie has many aspects that are far ahead of its own time  and far too advanced for the people who watched it when it was released.\n\nBenegal&apos;s ability to deal with such vital themes makes the movie all the more amazing. Of course, from a simple entertainment standpoint, the movie is rife with short humor and phenomenal close up shots. In fact, there are many off screen elements to the movie that throw hints at the viewer about what is happening; Benegal almost emulates the great Thomas Hardy, except in film.\n\nRATING","[""Drama""]","""2019-01-02""","""village,affair,deaf mute,toddy,caste system""","""2H11M""",48.0

You know it and I know it where this story would end, you don&apos;t need me to show the direction, do you?

His acting is so pretentious with limited emotions and passions, without even trying to break some new ground for his later day acting transcendence or enhancement. There are more better senior actors to play this role but the casting agency seemed still believe this guy got some box office attraction. Believe you me, dude, he&apos;s not, because he can only play the same dead fish like character in different titled movies.\n\nThe other two young actors indeed tried very hard to play the roles but since the screenplay is so formulaic and so predictable, they are just two very uninteresting characters in a very boring predictable movie. The only thing that needs to be recommended to these two younger actors is that they have shown been working out daily, so the long chase in the busy business area didn&apos;t show any fatigue or heavy breaths in the end. Obviously, the chase have been shot and edited together scene by scene, so they could still look so tireless.\n\nThis is a very predictable and very forgettable old movie with a new title and different actors.

Mercury Rising, I was happy with and entertained, which was what this government cover-up story was all about. As the sort of troubled outcast on somewhat good-terms Willis is a master. This is a lock-fit for him, he does it so well and on the other hand he slips out and accomplishes other performances with just the same skill. I.e. &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; (1999) creepy-good story that he brings that Ole&apos; Willis insight to and gives a leveled measure of believable acting that makes you say &quot;Wow&quot;. This given, I liked the original working title to the film, Mercury Falling would have worked well too. The autistic boy, (Miko ) is really outstanding at bringing in the over/under balanced brain of Autism to understated believability. He brought that character to it&apos;s living end. That is impressive for such young actors to have so much meddle that they can use in their craft. Then there is the one who makes &apos;hating heavies&apos; a way of life, Alec Baldwin, who always can appear meaner that a bull- rattle snake. His F.B.I man is as solid and scary {as the I would think} the real mean ones come. All in all fairness, this lacked totally connecting everything for a perfect film, but if you watch it uninterrupted and settle in to enjoy what this is, you should get a lot of story entertainment out of it, no problem. There is a lot of garbage made these days, and it is refreshing to see a story that you can watch and take something else away, the next viewing as well. \n\nBruce has the juice...(****) Recommended for Willis fans, but not limited to."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Crime"",""Drama""]","""1998-12-21""","""autistic child,autism,assassin,9 year old,hospital""","""1H51M""",24.0

There is hope, hopelessness, faith, desperation, innocence all rolled into one. Without being political or aligned with either side, santosh sivan manages to portray just what is-a sad time of Kashmir&apos;s history, loss of an immense spiritual tradition and history, and shows how the downtrodden are the ultimate puppet victims in a game played by governments and terrorists. There were a lot of loose ends for me in this movie however, what happens to the mother&apos;s search, what happens after the intended plan is foiled- I was left wanting to know more but felt watching the credits roll by a little unresolved. The movie is slow to unfold initially but builds up to an almost intolerable suspense. The visual richness will keep those with an eye for this satiated. I was grateful to watch the Kashmiri landscape and play of light in every one of Mr. Sivan&apos;s shots. The subtleties were not lost upon this fan.

This 25 minutes spell is also the driest of all comic events that occur throughout the movie. However, if you can get past this part, you are certainly in for a treat.\n\nThe movie only picks up after the poor start. The jokes get continuously better and funnier, and the situational comedy simply cannot be ignored. Some scenes are a pure laugh riot to those who enjoy clever and well-scripted comedy (as opposed to silly banter that most comedy movies these days are now filled with).\n\nThe story ties up nicely, though I have to say that the portrayal of the ending could have been a little better. There is nothing wrong with the conclusion reached, but rather the way they approached it following the climax. Of course, the story was somewhat predictable, but the director still managed to keep it fresh.\n\nActing was great as well. Some actors excelled, while others ranked merely above the line of mediocrity. For instance, Hritesh was excellent in his comic role. He truly has a knack for comedy. Ayesha, as always, portrays a sweet and innocent attitude such convincingly that you can&apos;t help but to be impressed by her. Rimi Sen, played her seductive role incredibly well, and keep note of her witty use of subtle facial expressions throughout the movie. Aftab didn&apos;t really stick out, but then again, his role was the most standard of all of them, and was also severely limited in the number of comic lines he spoke.\n\nAll in All, the movie was highly enjoyable, so long as you don&apos;t focus on the few flaws. Of course, the movie isn&apos;t perfect, there are many things that could have been done better, cinematography and editing-wise that would have improved the movie, but it still served as a great Time pass, at the least.

Having said that, Parichay is overall an engaging and watchable picture. It is said to be a remake of The Sound of Music, but Gulzar clearly denied this, and I also think it is very different. The movie is a rather ordinary family drama, and as expected from Gulzar, it&apos;s never melodramatic or overly clichéd. Don&apos;t know if the film was intended for kids or not, but children will definitely enjoy the film much more, given the kids have more screen time than any other actor and in a way the story is at times seen through their eyes. The lead pair is played by Jeetendra and Jaya Bhaduri, both of whom are convincing in their roles. Those were the days when Jeetendra was at his best and acted in better movies than those he would be a part of later in his career. Bhaduri is unsurprisingly restrained and natural and plays her role with ease. The supporting cast includes Pran, as the estranged grandfather who is a tough man of principles, and Sanjeev Kumar, as his son. Both actors are excellent. One of the film&apos;s highlights is definitely the music, composed by master R.D Burman. Gulzar&apos;s direction, casting and his ability to keep everything simple despite the ongoing proceedings, along with the lovely songs, create a movie that is enjoyable, even if it&apos;s not one of his most memorable pictures."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama"",""Family"",""Musical""]","""1972-10-18""","""teacher,children,picnic,mischief,brother sister relationship""","""2H25M""",50.0

His younger and good looking wife is mourning in front of Police then locks herself in bedroom and her cry converts into laughter. This opening scene is so stale. This first bite gives you the bitter taste about the rest meal. Film is full of irritating melo drama with topping of bad performances. Screenplay has everything except mind. Dialogues are good at places. One can sneak into bedroom of a high profile person house and even with opening door with keys!? A girl is sleeping so soundly even after being brutally beaten, as screenplay says but doesn&apos;t look like, that sneaking person make love on carpet while she is sleeping!? Police comes in starting to investigate for the first death but then vanishes in nowhere or writer had just forget or didn&apos;t think it worth to take ahead!? A person takes another person body so easily from a high profile Hospital like cake walk!? Buried in graveyard and after something comes in front of you in climax, which is just ridiculously kiddies. Just tossing a medical drug is enough to justify all this as makers think. Climax and pre climax is so haphazard. Performance wise Patralekha as Ramona is good at places.

So probably they wished to keep a gap to avoid the obvious comparisons. Then in the beginning of this year it was reported that there were some financial issues which was the reason behind this strange delay. But just recently I was informed that Preity had herself stalled the release as her director was being treated for Cancer. Hearing the news I felt hugely shocked because this was something I had rarely seen happening in the film industry before, that a producer was more interested in the good health of his/her director than the release of the film itself. And for this I would eagerly like to give my utmost love, respect and salute to the lady in charge, Preity Zinta.\n\nReturning to the film, honestly I wished it to be a major hit just for Preity Zinta alone. But unfortunately my wish was not granted as the film turned out to be a big disappointment having nothing fresh to say in the genre of Love Stories. Moreover it was also frustrating to realize that it was yet another highly inspired version of the classic western series of BEFORE SUNRISE (1995) and BEFORE SUNSET (2004) directed by Richard Linklater. Incidentally, the third part of this series titled BEFORE MIDNIGHT featuring the same lead actors Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is scheduled to be released today itself in the west. And here we are still into making the repeated versions of their Ist parts only in 2013.\n\nAs mentioned in the beginning, last year we had London Paris NEW YORK, based on the same much appreciated series, with a similar kind of script. And for the new friends here, this is what I had written in its review to be precise, &quot;If you are a lover or have felt the true love ever in your entire past then do watch BEFORE SUNRISE (1995) and BEFORE SUNSET (2004) both, like an essential medication for your precious life. London Paris NEW YORK might be cute in its own limited way but director Richard Linklater&apos;s two babies really talk about something of the BEYOND..............which cannot be copied ever.&quot;\n\nAnd that&apos;s exactly, what I wish to convey here again about ISHKQ IN Paris, that few films can never be copied and its really foolish trying to create the same magic on the screen again with two different actors in a different region &amp; language. In fact some cinematic gems are just meant to be cherished and not remade. And the truth needs to be understood well before you decide to go for something similar.\n\nFor instance, we are very much interested in getting inspired from the foreign gems but still are too conservative when it comes to use the word &apos;Sex&apos; on the screen. So here we have a dice in the film which readily shows everything from Party, Dinner and Coffee but is too shy to show the side having the three letter word written on it like a perfect Indian traditional dice. Apparently ISHKQ IN Paris has several such insertions which seem to be completely forced in to give it a more Indian feel. But not a single one comes out as a winner, resulting in a very clichéd, predictable &amp; feeble attempt in the end.\n\nFirstly, there is no chemistry between its lead characters which doesn&apos;t let you feel the romance in their eyes ever. Secondly the narrative format (of a voice over) is quite annoying along with the foreign mother character, simply thrown in to justify the Paris angle. Shekhar Kapoor&apos;s cameo remains wasted and so is the location of Paris, since the city could have been used like a hidden character of the film as promoted in its title. Following the typical Bollywood pattern of nowadays, ISHKQ IN Paris reaches the same old Punjabi Wedding venue in the end and then there comes a Bhangra song too to ruin it further. In few words, the film has nothing much to say in its first half supporting a very slow progression and then the second half falls back to everything seen before and routine resulting in a lackluster climax, which can also be rated as childish.\n\nUnexpectedly, music is the weakest part of this romantic venture, wherein nothing manages to stay with you once its over. Not even the song in which Salman Khan gives a stage performance as his guest appearance (returning the favour, Preity did for his MR &amp; MRS KHANNA). The cinematography and background score is just OK and the same can be said about its dialogues too, which do not have something special to offer to the viewers.\n\nSo that brings us to the performances wherein Rhehan is sweet and confident but the film completely belongs to the vivacious Preity Zinta alone as she remains the lifeline of her self-produced project throughout. Such is the impact of her lively act that after a while it becomes painful to admit that the talented lady is putting so much effort into a film which has a very weak backbone or script in the first place. Preity enjoys the best of her form in ISHKQ IN Paris and that can become the only reason for the ones who wish to see it in the theaters."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Romance""]","""2013-05-24""","{""total"":0","""1H35M""",9.0

I must avow that it&apos;s futile to expect anything sensible except for mindless mediocrity. If there&apos;s a universally reviled film this year, it&apos;s Fox Star Studios &amp; Ad-Labs Films Limited&apos;s The Zoya Factor, more so because some of director Abhishek Sharma&apos;s earlier films were hits. No director can be senseless enough to think this is fine or remotely funny.\n\nIdiocy is a gentle term for what is unleashed upon us. It&apos;s a two hour show reel of plot-less, witless, joylessness. Silliness can be great fun. But brainless doesn&apos;t have to translate to brain-dead. The direction is a complete let-down. The situational gags try too hard to tickle the funny bones of the viewers consummately and the essence of the story gets dissipated because of unwanted scenes galore with no tie-in to the ongoing. It doesn&apos;t even get its &apos;Cricket&apos; aspect right. The direction is middle-of-the-road precisely, as the writing (Anuja Chauhan, Pradhuman Singh Mall and Neha Sharma) lacks the meat and the sequence of events just don&apos;t work. The pace also mar the overall impact with songs acting as killjoy. After Studios&apos; VFX is pathetic. The Zoya Factor will drain you at the end.\n\nWhile it begins on a promising note - it&apos;s a premise ripe with comic potential - the graph only spirals southwards barely half an hour into the film. It&apos;s not sacrilege to attempt a no-brainer but the smiles/guffaw/laughter should never be in short supply. The actors, putting their best foot forward, try so so so hard to make you giggle even when the gags are weak. The banal jokes and the lame PJs coupled with the muddled screenplay are clearly responsible for the royal mess.\n\nBecause there&apos;s little to count on in terms of story, the fate of The Zoya Factor depends almost entirely on the likeability of its leads. The film belongs to Dulquer Salmaan , who proves, yet again, that he is an incredible actor. He adds so much to the sequences. Sonam Kapoor delivers an earnest performance but she fails to rise above the flawed script. Angad Bedi does complete justice to his character. Sikandar Kher seems comfortable in the given space. Sanjay Kapoor is natural. Anil Kapoor&apos;s cameo is hilarious. Manu Rishi Chadha is fine, not overdoing the lisping bit. Koel Purie is strictly okay. Pooja Bhamrrah (Sonali) looks quite glamorous and plays the supporting part well. From the Cricketers, the ones who leave the mark are Abhilash Chaudhary (Shivi), Gandharv Dewan (Harry) and Sachin Deshpande (Lakhi).\n\nTo sum up, The Zoya Factor is not entirely unwatchable because it&apos;s shot in a manner that&apos;s easy on the eye. But walking out of the cinema once the lights come back on, you&apos;re just glad it&apos;s finally over. Stay miles away from it!

Of the two, if we take a look at that rather colorful array of movies that have attempted to paint Islamic fundamentalism in a shade more palatable to the untrained layman palette, some great examples (&apos;Aamir&apos;,&apos;Sarfarosh&apos;), some decent instances (&apos;Anwar&apos;,&apos;Yeh Hai Mera India&apos;,&apos;Yeh Hai Mumbai Meri Jaan&apos;) and some Herculean debacles(&apos;My name is Khan&apos;, &apos;Kurbaan&apos;) come to the foreground. Whilst all the aforementioned movies had varying degrees of success with portraying the life and times of an ordinary Muslim in today&apos;s India, there has never really been an attempt to juxtapose the Muslim community against Gandhi&apos;s backdrop. For that, &apos;Road to Sangam&apos;(RTS) has my respect.\n\nNow, I am not a hardcore Gandhian. I have read abundant material on the man, exhaustive literature on his legend and certainly seen a dozen variations of his mantra in recent celluloid years. Notwithstanding my personal views of the Mahatma, I was getting a tad frustrated at how almost every movie that used him as the nucleus, would invariably get so sugary at one point that one could die instantly from that lethal injection of diabetic shock. His message of global peace, non-violence and inter-communal brotherhood would be echoed way beyond the subtle reality it so desperately needed. Thus, making an erstwhile honest attempt, seem preachy and philosophical.\n\nWhat makes RTS more authentic in such a stereotypical scenario is how it attempts to demystify the reasons why Maulwi saahibs and other patriarchal Muslims are screaming from atop mosque enclosures and what the everyday worker is hearing sitting in front of them, convinced that they know more about what being a true Muslim is. RTS dissects that so neatly that it takes your breathe away.\n\nThe premise revolves around Hashmatullah (Paresh Rawal), a renowned mechanic and a devout Muslim, who works out of his grease stained garage in Allahabad. He is the general secretary of his community&apos;s organization which is headed by one time friend Mohammad Ali Kasuri (Om Puri) and the local Maulwi Maulana Qureshi (Pavan Malhotra). Hashmat is a non-threatening fellow who sits in on rhetorical meetings spilling with the irate and cranky Maulwi&apos;s never ending rants about how Muslims are being targeted each day in today&apos;s India. Despite his ideology that are slightly different from that of his peers, he does not see the need to voice his philosophy in their presence. He nods his head, joins in their hymns and plays his role to the T.\n\nAnd then one day a bomb goes off. A few prominent Muslims are arrested by the police and this sends shocks of rage across the community. They unanimously agree to shut down their businesses in protest of what they are convinced is a racist act. Hashmat, without a choice, reluctantly joins in not realizing that a recent project that has come his way, of fixing an age old Ford&apos;s rusty and dead engine, is in fact of the same vehicle that had once carried the Mahatma&apos;s ashes after his death in 1948. This, for a reason he cannot completely fathom, changes Hashmat&apos;s priorities.\n\nOn the one hand he does consider himself a true follower of the Koran and a blue blooded supporter of his organization. On the other, there is his conscience that continues to prick him into the confession that his little deed of helping the Mahatma&apos;s final bounty of ashes to be submerged into the Triveni Sangam (a spot where the rivers Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati meet), somehow seems like a more justified statement of Muslim being a faith of peace, rather than shutting off work and listening to a radically inclined Mullah each day. Thus, aware of the respect he knows he needs to pay to the man who was assassinated for being an open supporter of the Muslims, Hashmat prepares to face the wrath of his own kin by reopening his shop to fix the engine. Hashmat&apos;s personal journey of awareness lit brightly by the knowledge of the true meaning of Islam culminates with the Mahatma&apos;s final journey into the rivers of the country he fought so hard to liberate.\n\nRTS is no average emotion-heavy movie that is high on religious jingoism without a clear degree of practicality. In fact, it is the most mature movie I have seen on the subject after &apos;Aamir&apos;. If &apos;Aamir&apos; was the attempt to present the true anti-thesis of a Jihadi, &apos;Road to Sangam&apos; paves the way for more clarity on the difference between blind fanatic adherence to one&apos;s faith and the need to see the bigger picture. That bigger, brighter, and more appropriate picture.\n\nI would definitely recommend a relevant film like &apos;Road to Sangam&apos; purely because of the honesty with which it unfolds its theme."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama"",""Thriller""]","""2010-01-29""","""police""","""2H15M""",13.0

Of course, there&apos;s also that trademark sequence of all characters walking towards camera in slow motion.But while Kaante owes much by way of debt to Tarantino&apos;s Reservoir Dogs of which it was a shameless ripoff,Acid Factory has been blatantly plagiarised from the lesser-seen 2006 thriller, Unknown.Five guys and one chick wake up in an abandoned chemical factory on the outskirts of Cape Town. They have been variously beaten, bound, shot and handcuffed, but nobody remembers a thing. Not even their names, or what they&apos;re doing there. A gas-leak at this factory has resulted in this temporary amnesia, you learn. Repeated phone-calls from a central figure seem to suggest that a kidnapping has taken place, and that two of them are going to die. Now the group must piece back their memories and work out the possible permutations -- who are the kidnappers and who&apos;s been kidnapped? -- before the mastermind behind this operation finally shows up. Borrowing too many tricks that have been used too many times before, director Suparn Verma kills what could have been an otherwise promising thriller by packing it with ridiculously silly chase scenes, gratuitous club songs, and outrageously idiotic dialogue.It doesn&apos;t help that Acid Factory comes with an all-star cast of jokers including Fardeen Khan, Dino Morea, Aftab Shivdasani and Dia Mirza who don&apos;t bring a shred of credibility to their roles. Even dependable actors like Irrfan Khan and Danny Denzongpa are wasted in thankless roles, while Manoj Bajpai hams it up as a maniacal criminal.

Just to see story-tellers (and not just star kids and diamond merchants) get a chance to create real cinema in Bollywood is so heartening. We loved this movie and so did the half-empty PVR audience, median age 35, if the constant eruptions of gleeful laughter are any indication.\n\nUnlike many good attempts, Dil Kabaddi does not falter in the second half simply because the director had a POINT to make. Maybe he has Woody Allen to thank for it, but this did not become a montage of slick shots against Mumbai&apos;s backdrop. All the humor and all the &quot;slice of life&quot; shots told a story. This is where the movie truly scores.\n\nThe other reason for its success, of course, is the excellent casting and performance. Each character was well-etched, including the &quot;almost correct&quot; English grammar and &quot;avant garde&quot; dress sense of Samit. His pairing with an intellectual, stylish, smart Mita is not that surprising in today&apos;s aspirational India-- a lot of successful women are truly happy with a less successful husband. I also liked the minor characters of ex-boyfriend, office hunk and Chirag the lech neighbor. Their body language and motivations reveal a well-written character as part of the screenplay. Something so rare even in mainstream Bollywood cinema. Ditto for the sex-jokes; they were much more tasteful than what is dished out in family-comedy &quot;U&quot; rated movies every week. That said, the &quot;Kaaya&quot; character could have been better etched.\n\nPerhaps the movie targets a very specific audience, the mid-30s Indian, that grew up on Karan Johar&apos;s bubble-gum romance in the 90s and are &quot;happily&quot; married for 4-7 years now, like the characters in the movie. It is possible that this crowd will laugh the loudest, while those older and younger may find less to identify with in this story. They may yet discover it on DVD a few years later and laugh hearty. At its core, it is a story about our quest for love and our failure to recognize it when it happens. A tale of finding love versus our &apos;fantasy&apos; of love.\n\nWhile some have panned the movie for it&apos;s shameless copy of Husbands and Wives by Woody Allen, others have cringed at the barrage of sexual jokes and innuendo. In my opinion, it works where Mixed Doubles (the previous multiplex outing about infidelity) failed simply because it does not hold back or have any intellectual pretense. The movie keeps you laughing almost the entire time and yet makes an honest observation about modern Indian marriages.\n\nThe fact that it holds true for India 16 years after Woody Allen&apos;s 1992 original is a telling comment on Indian society playing catch-up with the west.

Yeh, complicated and messy it is. The film&apos;s saving grace may be Madhuri Dixit who delivers a sincere and natural performance. Ajay Devgan is completely unimpressive here, so is Preity Zinta, who is just okay and whose charm and vivaciousness seem to be missing in this act. Perhaps the most watchable sequence in the entire movie is the song &quot;Jo Pyaar Karta Hai&quot;. It is a beautiful and moving song and the acting of the actors on-screen while they are singing it is convincing, particularly the contradicting moods of Zinta and Dixit, the former having sad and poignant expressions and the latter being happy and joyful. Anyway, this film is still not worth your time so you better spend it for a better purpose."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Drama"",""Romance""]","""2001-08-10""","""title sung by character,con artist,con man,con woman,car thief""","""2H29M""",21.0

Through this film, Benegal presents the world of young prostitutes and their madame, all of whom reside in an old brothel in Hyderabad. But unlike the glamorous portrayal of courtesans which are so common in Hindi movies, here we see an authentic and realistic depiction of the routine and effervescent neighbourhood and the brothel in particular. Benegal perfectly captures the atmosphere of the people residing in the village and his portrayal of their lifestyle is very impressive.\n\nMandi explores the hypocrisy of the society, but it&apos;s not as much a social movie as it is a satirical comedy. This is one of Benegal&apos;s most enjoyable movies in this regard. The film includes so many hilarious moments, keeping the audience entertained and yet never losing its seriousness. The humour comes in equal parts from the superb witty dialogues, the lifelike situations, the colourful characters, and the dark, ironic mood of the film, in which a serene but humorous narrative presents serious issues and flavours them with great sarcasm. That&apos;s what makes the film the more so amusing and funny.\n\nOne of the reasons Mandi works is the collaborative work of the ensemble cast, which includes some of the most talented actors in India, all of whom understand the film&apos;s darkly comic tone and act accordingly. Unquestionably, it is Shabana Azmi who leads the film as Rukmini, the domineering but caring madame of the house. At 33, Azmi plays a woman much ahead of her years, and she delivers an incredibly convincing and colourful portrayal, which is unrestrained and subtle at the same time. In preparation for the role, Azmi put on weight, and despite looking young, she definitely looks the part. Her unusually loud tone and crudely unrefined mannerisms are masterfully done, and it&apos;s both amazing and amusing to see her switching moods from angry to happy to suffering to motherly and loving. This is one of her most entertaining performances.\n\nThe rest of the cast is there to support Azmi, with Smita Patil and Naseeruddin Shah acquiring top honours. Patil is wonderful as the young and gentle Zeenat, who is also Rukmini&apos;s most beloved girl in the brothel, whom she has treated like her own daughter and for whom she cares the most. Shah delivers a greatly ambiguous performance as Rukmini&apos;s loyal employee, who indulges in funny and diverting emotional outbursts when she is not nearby. Kulbhushan Kharbanda is very good as the sophisticated businessman. Saeed Jaffrey is hilarious as Agarwal, who shares a common secret with Rukmini. Om Puri, Amrish Puri, and Pankaj Kapur lend adequate support in smaller parts, and so does the entire group of the brothel&apos;s girls, which includes such famous names as Ila Arun, Anita Kanwar, Ratna Pathak, Neena Gupta and Soni Razdan.\n\nMandi has music composed by Vanraj Bhatia, a regular in Benegal films. There are very few songs, but they are all nice. Mandi is a highly watchable movie. My favourite scenes are those taking place in Zeenat&apos;s room when several men come to visit her, much to Rukmini&apos;s displeasure. I loved the film&apos;s ending. Despite leaving several questions unanswered, it shows that there always is a ray of hope in everything. One of Shyam Benegal&apos;s most unusually crafted works, a great film with dark humour (which is so missing in Indian movies) and fantastic performances, which deserves many repeat viewings."",""reviewRating""", , , ,"""2H47M""",39.0

He is one of the very few actors in Indian cinema who has succeeded in bridging the lamentable divide that exists between &apos;sensible&apos;(read realistic) and &apos;glamour&apos;(songs and dances and fight sequences by the dozen peppered with rain dances/bathing beauties played out by the heroine/vamp in skimpy costumes out to titillate the viewers while walking the thin red line between the &apos;acceptable&apos; and &apos;obscene&apos;, based on the notoriously arbitrary censorship laws in India) cinema during the 80s and early 90s. The &apos;parallel cinema&apos; during the late &apos;70s and early &apos;80s produced several noteworthy films like &apos;Mirch Masala&apos;,&apos;Jaane Bhi Do Yaro&apos;, &apos;Masoom&apos;, &apos;Waisa Bhi Hota Hain&apos;, all of which were commercial successes. Although he then went on to act in movies like Tridev, which would undoubtedly fall into the &apos;glamour&apos;/&apos;mainstream&apos; cinema, he is still considered to be one of the best actors ever in Indian cinema.\n\nThe long winding title &apos; Yun Hota Toh Kya Hota&apos;( which can be translated as &quot;What if it had happened thus?&apos;) comes with a mercifully shortened title &quot;What if..?&apos; in the subtitles accompanying the movie. The story is about 4 complete strangers bound by one fateful day in their lives.\n\nThe Bride There is the newly wed couple of Tilottama Das and Hemant Punj (played by Konkona Sen Sharma and Jimmy Sheirgill) who have just tied the note after an &apos;internet&apos; courtship and marriage. Hemant who works in the U.S. is about to travel back to his work, the day after his wedding reception. Tilottama would stay back with her in-laws -Papaji(played by Ravi Baswani) and Mom and a dysfunctional Sis-in-law undergoing a divorce, till her American visa gets ready. Caught between a sadistic mother-in-law and a schizophrenic sis-in-law, and the visa papers that never arrive and long distance calls from her husband that she is never able to attend, she decides get to the U.S. by whatever means it takes- be it lying to the officer at the visa section or keeping her motives hidden from her overbearing mum-in-law.\n\nThe Student Rahul Bhide(Ankur Khanna) is a brilliant but impoverished medical graduate who is caught between lack of finances and a sense of duty towards his ailing father on the one hand and the prospects that awaits him in the land of opportunities on the other. Aided by a twist of fate and financed by his friend Kay Modi(Ayesha Takia) he travels to the U.S. in search of his destiny.\n\nThe Lover The stock broker son (Irrfan Khan) of an underworld Don( Saroj Khan), gets involved in the murder of a corrupt police officer and is forced to leave to the U.S., where he is to meet with a prospective employer who would take him under his wings. He is torn between his love for the much older, but passionate lover Namrata( Suhasini Mulay) and his inability to reconcile with her infidelity on the other.\n\nThe Showman Rajubhai Patel ( Paresh Rawal) is a small time organizer of &apos;cultural shows&apos; in the U.S. and it costs any aspiring dancer a small fortune to join his group. He is approached by his erstwhile love interest Tara Gandhi( Ratna Pathak Shah) and asked to take her daughter Payal(Shahana Goswami) to the U.S., away from an abusive father and poverty, paying him with the money that she received by mortgaging her home. Rajubhai for the first time in his life is fathering an innocent girl on her first trip abroad.\n\nFour startlingly different lives, yet bound by fate to come together in one unexpected journey. The fate they encounter unfurls in the climax of the film.\n\nExceptionally well directed, the film has a well written screenplay by Uttam Gada and some excellent photography by Hemant Chaturvedi. The transition between the characters and their environs is well reflected in the photography, which I understand was achieved by using a different lens for each protagonist and the transition from the pastel shades of India to the vibrant colors of the U.S. is captivating. Some excellent editing by Hina Salyada and a sense of conciseness in the director( which is so very often sorely lacking in Indian Cinema) makes the film an enjoyable watch. Also noteworthy is the Visual Effects by Pankaj Khandpur who tops it off with some excellent shots for the climax.\n\nAll-in-all a welcome breath of fresh air in Hindi cinema which has now shown lots of promise with the advent of a new crop of directors and script writers who believe that cinema is not only about endless strings of song and dance woven around opulent weddings and display of wealth, which would be as out of place in middle class India as anywhere else in the world."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama""]","""2006-07-21""","""united states of america,coincidence,visa,simultaneity,reuniting""","""1H55M""",16.0

The film upholds an important principle that the disabled want to live independently, to be accorded the dignity and respect other sectors of society are granted.They don&apos;t want sympathy, rather they want and need normal behaviour towards them.\n\nAnirudh Parmar (Naseerudin Shah), a visually impaired young man, runs a school for the blind as a principal.He works towards making his students self-reliant and hates the society for pitying people like him.One evening, at a party, he meets Kavita (Shabana Azmi), a young widow, and offers her to teach in his school.\n\nReluctant at first, Kavita eventually joins the school. She starts enjoying the company of the blind children and they too feel comfortable with her. Gradually, Anirudh and Kavita fall in love and get engaged.

It&apos;s a roller coaster ride with enjoyable sequences and well written scenes along with splendid performances by the entire star-cast.\n\nThe movie takes off slowly, creating the required ambiance for its characters to establish themselves. And after 15 initial minutes, it drags you in and starts entertaining with its superb enthralling narration. The story moves around a few amusing characters who all have to pay back huge amount of money to a big Gangster of the town. Now how they all manage to arrange that money, which keeps changing hands every five minutes, is the small gist of the movie.\n\nThe first half moves on an electrifying pace as compared to the later. The second half has only few minutes of dragging and predictable scenes but then it also picks up the pace, progressing towards an engrossing and surprising climax. Sequences related to various characters are interconnected superbly, backed by some great skillful writing. The star-case ensemble has everyone giving a worth watching performance in their own respective roles. The most entertaining one comes from Dilip Prabhawalkar, as the old man who is a master in re-painting the stolen cars. Kay Kay Menon as the car thief impresses once again with his effortless act. Anupam Kher bounces back with his famous comic timing as the big Gangster. Rimi Sen looks cool and convincing playing the con woman. Chunky Pandey (the actor), Manoj Pahwa (the producer), Yashpal Sharma (the businessman), Rahul Dev (the contract killer) and Virendera Saxena (the imposter Godman), all leave a good impact in their brief roles.\n\nMusically, it has only a few songs, used briefly along with the moving storyline. So, they don&apos;t act as an obstacle in the high paced drama. Cinematography is simply basic, with no special gimmick or lighting used to enhance the scenes. But even then, the director keeps you glued to your seats with his interesting and unexpected twists and turns in the story. The intelligent remarks on fake religious figures and sexual fantasies are a treat to watch in this black comedy. Though it also has some major flaws in the storyline but the fast proceedings on the screen don&apos;t give you the moment to think about them.\n\nIn short, if you love the genre of thrillers without heavy action, relying more on conspiracies, plans and last minute upsets, then &quot;Sankat City&quot; will not disappoint you, if given a chance. It&apos;s a brilliant take on conmen, media world and gangsters on the similar lines of &quot;Ek Chalis Ki Last Local&quot;. A must watch as the small surprise package of the season."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Crime"",""Drama""]","""2009-07-10""","""gangster,money lender,garage,long lost brother,garbage dump""","""2H""",13.0

A great story of true Love caught up in corruption and politics, with a real message to the young that is trying to put out a message to them to revolt against the SYSTEM of corruption, and all with a cracking cast to boot. The first half of the movie is set in a beautiful village in Nainital, where you would expect the locals to tow the line when corrupt land developers come into town. Here you see Rishi Kapoor introduced and as always has a presence you always love to be a part of. To me Rishi in whatever he does is like seeing and an old friend and I often think why can&apos;t we see more of him on screen, so I can revisit that old friendship again. He shows his enjoyable quirky nature and timing, even on subtle levels that show how seasoned he is. A supreme performer. Well his son(Rishabh Sinha) falls in love with a local woman Kaanchi(Mishti) that has her true heart on a local boy(Kartik Tiwari), she has grown up with. Here Kaanchi&apos;s love is tested but her real heart comes through in the end. As usual Bollywood comes through with great love scenes that only they know best how to do. Hollywood obscure approach to Love never seems to come close these days. However his OBSESSION takes over and because he can&apos;t get what he wants decides on the unspeakable. Here the movie comes to the point of the story where the law, news media, politicians who are driven by a corrupt SYSTEM fall over and cover up. Even families are resigned to the fact of what can we do to change and seek justice.\n\nWell they have met there match with Kaanchi, who won&apos;t give in and decide to try to set things right. At this point let me say with fervor how enjoyable is it to see Mishti on screen. Mishti is personality PLUS and every scene of her on screen is like a magnet pulling you into her magic. The only other actress with this pull to me is Rani and if you want to feel that world that transcends acting then this movie will be a breath of fresh air for you.\n\nAfter the INTERMISSION the second half of the movie doesn&apos;t disappoint, we find ourselves in MUMBHAI and Kaanchi cleverly infiltrates the dangerous and sleazy world of corruption at all levels and stops at nothing to expose the world of Corruption. This story has impact on many levels and her determination as a woman to achieve what everyone else decides to give up is inspirational. The scene of Kaanchi&apos;s mother coming to try and convince her to return to the village, but again being refused shows emotionally how deep her determination had to go to achieve success in the end. Again I am glad I did see this movie, and all in all a great movie. Highly Recommended."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama"",""Musical"",""Romance""]","""2014-04-25""","{""total"":0","""2H31M""",8.0

So when the talented co-writer and actor of GOW, Zeishan Quadri comes up with his directorial debut written by himself then it obviously raises your expectation to sky high, excitingly looking for many innovative as well as entertaining characters such as Definite (played by himself), Perpendicular, Tangent and a lot more.\n\nHowever, maybe it was the reputation of a path-breaking triumph achieved in the past or the over-excitement (or confidence) of handling a solo project with an interesting cast, Quadri&apos;s MEERUTHIYA GANGSTERS doesn&apos;t turn out to be as engrossing and impressive as expected with only few engaging moments towards the end, questionably once again made on an &apos;all repetitive script&apos; delivering the routine content.\n\nYes, as a writer he does create many catchy characters giving you the raw feel of a small town gang, their unplanned loots and gang- wars. But fails to infuse any fast paced thrill on the screen lacking that likable charm and finesse in many potential sequences. Clearly accepting a heavy Tarantino influence, the film begins focusing on a group of goons discussing their latest crime (exactly like in RESERVOIR DOGS) with the camera constantly revolving around them in circles creating an avoidable, uneasy feel. And as you get to know more side-characters introduced next (played by some known names), one honestly starts expecting something fresh or never seen before to surface soon in either the plot line or execution coming from the promising Quadri.\n\nSurprisingly nothing of that sort happens in the entire first hour and the film keeps moving without any excitement as such heading towards the same old familiar theme of&apos;kidnapping and ransom scheme gone wrong&apos; offering nothing novel or appreciable in terms of entertainment or return of your money spent.\n\nIn short the major saving grace of the project remains its occasional humour and the last 45 minutes when one of them gets shot willfully and the investigations actually begin bringing the viewer in. The second feature that doesn&apos;t let you write-off MEERUTHIYA GANGSTERS completely is its performances with all fine actors playing their given roles sincerely including Jaideep Ahlawat, Aakash Dahiya, Chandrachur Rai, Vansh Bhardwaj, Jatin Sharma, Shadab Kamal and Nushrat Bharucha as the only leading lady in the goon&apos;s team. Plus providing their professional support to the youngsters are Sanjay Sharma (as Mama ji), Brijendra Kala (as the employer) and Mukul Dev as the rough, arrogant police officer of Meeruth. The film&apos;s music department (including a promotional song by cricketer Suresh Raina), its cinematography, art direction and dialogues try hard to convert it into an underdog venture looking for praises, but I seriously wish the team was given a better script to perform on and create the magic.\n\nAnyway, ending it all with the same (circling) camera movement seen in the film&apos;s first shot, writer- director Zeishan Quadri certainly displays his exceptional cinematic sparks and is sure to bounce back with something better soon.\n\nTill then you can still watch MEERUTHIYA GANGSTERS, only if you can personally relate to the particular region and wish to see an honest collective attempt that should have been a lot better."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Crime""]","""2015-09-18""","""gangster""","""2H9M""",7.0

He wanted to carry on his traditional &quot;D......E&quot; type of titles, but unfortunately failed in the third installment which is unlike James Bond route. Also Ajay&apos;s double role for second time did not produce any pure scenting smoke, instead resulted in a big bombing at box-office. He played double as a cop and other as a crook made no exception to flop the movie. The twisting love story with another third angle Mahima made it very poor and boring. It&apos;s usually a common story &apos;re-wined again and again in a new bottle&apos; with new brand names and looks. Sometimes copying the taste and smell from another brands.\n\nA big fact is that, Deewane was released on the same day with heart-throbbing blockbuster Dhadkan. In that case Mahima had a great achieving as she starred in both these movies as a cameo role. Dhadkan was a huge hit whereas Deewane was out of discussion."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Romance""]","""2000-08-11""","""love triangle,shootout,boyfriend girlfriend relationship,tough cop,helicopter""","""2H44M""",22.0

The story subject is no new. It has been beaten to death by several directors in Indian cinema.\n\nWhat makes Thakshak watchable is Govind Nihalani&apos;s treatment of the subject and, good acting by Ajay Devgan, Rahul Bose and Tabu. Instead of having too many gun shots and killings, Govind Nihalani through one family killing brings five view points together; the view of common people (Tabu); the view of the guy who understands the underworld he is in and who is trying to understand the common people through his love (Ishaan); the arrogance of power (Sunny, Rahul Bose); the view of the government elected-by common people; and, the view of law protecting the common people. Note that the later two are also part of the power play. Govind Nihalani churns a nice tale around these view points and gives an entertaining movie.\n\nHowever, Thakshak falls short of the standard set by Govind Nihalani himself. From the very first scene of the movie, he shows that Ishaan sees the world through the eyes of his love Suman and she is his salvation. Also, from the first killing itself Nihalani shows the arrogance of power (listen to the dialogues of Sunny and the retired teacher) . If only Nihalani had kept Thakshak tightly around these premise with strong dialogues and screen play (thark/vithark) instead of putting onus on acting skills (of Ajay Devgan, Rahul Bose and Tabu) and songs, Thakshak would have been another master piece. Especially, the presence of songs make the movie slow and lengthy and at times loses the attention of the audience (the songs only give Tabu more screen presence). The acting of the three main characters is first rate but if there was strong interaction between these characters in-terms of strong screen play and dialogue (in most of the scenes between Tabu and Ajay Devgan, Ajay Devgan keeps quite with a sad face; this is true with other scenes of Ajay Devgan too), Ishaan and Suman would have also left lasting impression like Sunny. I think Nihalani realized it and avoided these mistakes while making is next commercial movie Dev, which is a real master piece.\n\nNevertheless, Thakshak is much better and entertaining than the standard bollywood movies."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Crime"",""Drama""]","""1999-12-03""","""builder,violence,psychopath,rivalry,gang war""","""2H43M""",23.0

One, that we are ready to experiment with fresh unexplored ideas and story plots, but still don&apos;t have the guts to stick to the main subject throughout the 2 hours of its duration. And second, we still take too much time in the initial reels and are not willing to reveal the main theme of our project in the first few minutes itself. Till date we very religiously believe in properly introducing our characters to the audiences, along with a few song and dance sequences for their relief and then come to main plot of the story.\n\nThat&apos;s what happens in JKSAH, when we are not shown the glimpses of the gorgeous lady coming from the other planet anywhere in the first 30 minutes of the movie. Instead we are introduced to the hero, his family, his sex maniac friend who stays with him day and night and his just found lady love from our own earth, in the first half an hour. It was really a strange step taken by the director, to hold up the things for so long when everything from the trailers to the posters were talking about the romance between the boy from earth and a girl from Venus. Still, the saving point is that the proceedings don&apos;t let you doze off due to many other interesting elements added by the director Milap Zaveri in the first half. Every key character in the story is working in a film crew, headed by Farah Khan herself in a superb cameo of a typical filmy director. This was indeed an intelligent thought put in by the writers since the viewers always enjoy watching the inside stories happening on a film shoot. The hilarious and witty moments in this particular part keep you alive and one actually doesn&apos;t mind waiting for the girl coming from Venus for a while.\n\nBut the problems start creeping up, when the Alien girl, Jacqueline, arrives on our planet in the most bizarre way. She simply falls from the sky in the arms of Ritesh. Putting it straight, all the excitement of watching an alien girl interacting with the young boy and then loving him, gets shattered due to the lack-luster treatment given by the director to the plot. Within few minutes, the alien girl starts talking, behaving and dressing like any other girl on earth and that takes away all the charm and freshness associated with the novel theme. Moreover the inclusion of the centuries old love triangle sequences in the second half push the movie into further lower platforms than expected. The moment the triangle comes into existence, it steals the entire entertainment factor from the movie and you just feel like waiting when it&apos;s going to end. That&apos;s what proves to be the real drawback of JKSAH when the director doesn&apos;t stick to the amusing narration; he successfully delivers in the first half. And the climax comes as another nail in the coffin since it fails to provide any convincing solution to the alien problem faced by the loving couple.\n\nPerformance wise, there are few worth mentioning acts in the movie, which mainly include the highly entertaining cameos by the Industry stalwarts such as Farah Khan, Sajid Khan, Akshay Kumar, Priyanka Chopra and Amrita Rao. An honest performance by Ritesh Deshmukh, who is now known for his mastery over comedy. A confident portrayal of an alien girl by Jacqueline, far better than her last &quot;Aladin&quot; and the pleasant presence of Sonal Sehgal who surely deserves to be given some better roles in the future. Apart from these, both Satish Shah and Supriya as Ritesh&apos;s parents are able to provide few comic moments in the first half. Vishal is superb as Ritesh&apos;s friend and Ruslaan shows signs of improvement in his Bollywood super star&apos;s act.\n\nSajid-Wajid&apos;s music sounds fine but they are not consistently coming up with some good songs as last heard in Salman&apos;s &quot;Veer&quot;. Camera-work is just all right as the director doesn&apos;t seem to be interested in using any kind of major special effects to enhance the overall impact of the story. So, the viewers expecting a good sci-fi romance out of it will be disappointed.\n\nConcisely, though it suggests being an out of this world romantic movie involving an alien girl, still it has nothing talking about the space or life on other planets in the universe. The makers opt for a safe way not getting into heavy graphics and animations, but in return come up with a below average product which could have been much better moving around a plot like this. In reality it is just another routine love triangle movie, supported by an alien plot in its storyline. With a marginally good first half and a very poor second one, a Home Video DVD of JKSAH will be the best option to go for in the coming weeks."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Drama"",""Fantasy""]","""2010-04-09""","""love""","""1H34M""",12.0

That was enough to excite me. But it was not until 2011 that I was finally able to see it. I had little expectations but I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe movie is quite good by Bollywood standards. The entire movie has been styled in the form of an epic with the heroes being molded as modern-day Paandavas in the Kurukshetra that a crime-filled Mumbai has become. The main story revolves around a demoralized Inspector Vijay (Akshay, probably as a replacement for Big B who could not play young roles anymore) who tries to fight crime single-handedly. His ideals clash with his elder brother Ashwin (Mukesh Khanna) who is the ACP of Mumbai. Noetheless, Vijay has high respects for his brother.\n\nThe city is lorded over by two tough gang lords, KK (Kiran Kumar) and Daata. Vijay tries to stop these ruffians with brains and brawn only to uncover a dark secret about his family. I should not reveal the rest of the movie, which has several unexpected twists and turns.\n\nDirection-wise,Raj Sippy is quite good here. But it is in the last 45 minutes of the movie that glaring loopholes start showing. An enormous amount of suspension of disbelief is required to take these sequences seriously. But the strong performances of the lead actors make up for the defects. This is &apos;90s Bollywood and so you have to put up with clichés of those times like attempted rape scenes, songs appearing out of nowhere, implausible powers of both protagonists and antagonists and above all, villains meeting an extremely gory end. Speaking of villains, they are almost reduced to caricatures in the beginning. Though, KK turns in an extremely competent performance in the later half which makes you loathe him with all your heart. \n\nHowever, the movie boasts of good enough dialogs that stay away from excess melodrama or patriotism. The writers have achieved the right balance and even incorporated modern terms for those times, such as &quot;Mercy Killing&quot;.\n\nAkshay is in top form here with restraint and subtlety in the confrontation scenes. Pankaj Dheer and Kiran Kumar are quite good too. Sadly, nothing much can be said about the others. Mukesh Khanna continues with his dramatics and the heroines are mainly there to look as glamorous dolls.\n\nMusic is very bad from Jatin Lalit with only the &quot;Pyar Ka Bukhar&quot; having a pleasing effect for the masses.\n\nOverall, an average 90&apos;s movie that was a semi-hit at the box office. A tighter script, good music and more plausible storyline could have made this one a masterpiece. Hope a good director like Raj Kumar Santoshi remakes this with more credibility to the plot. Incidentally, Santoshi&apos;s &quot;Khakee&quot; (2004) seems to be inspired by this movie. But that was a lot better and can even be held as a modern classic.\n\nMy rating - 6/10. Watch this only if you like 90&apos;s movies. You won&apos;t be disappointed.""},""aggregateRating""","[""Action"",""Drama""]","""1995-03-03""","""police officer,brother brother relationship,police commissioner,tough cop,organized crime""","""2H12M""",27.0

Despite the negativity on all the other reviews, i am going to be different and say i throughly enjoyed this movie, to much of an extent that it has earned a spot in my &apos;favourite list&apos;. My first viewing of this movie was 6 years ago and i enjoyed it. This got me by surprise, as it was of Amitabh, the elderly man who danced around in &apos;Say Shaba Shaba&apos;from KKKG! I had never seen a movie of him in his younger days, but boy am i glad i did and i think it earned my respect towards him and made me realise why everyone is crazy over him! I fell in love with the story, songs and characters, but none more so of &apos;Jamuna&apos;, (played by Meenakshi Seshadri), as her every scene entertained me! She has the looks, comedic skills and the voice! This movie re-led me to watch other movies of the 80&apos;s and to seek out movies of Meenakshi and Jaya Prada, who are now my favourite actresses of the 80s, and also of A.B&apos;s. I also loved the pairings of Meenakshi/A.B and Jaya/A.B, and always try to find movies of these two pairs. I loved the story as it showed a brief introduction of &apos;Ganga&apos; &apos;Jamuna&apos; and &apos;Saraswati&apos; and how they all connect with one another by the events of the movie. The story was entertaining as it had romance, comedy (the mouse &amp; tub scene haha), action and heartfelt songs. This movie became an instant hit within me and i loved Jamuna and Saraswati! What i still can&apos;t believe is that this movie was a super flop! Never the less, i still love it, so much that i even watched it yesterday night, and still have not got bored of it.\n\nRemember readers, never judge a movie through the words of a critic, as you have to watch it for yourself and decide whether you like it or not. Luckily i found this gem of a movie through the persistence of my mum to watch it, and have never regretted since, as it re-introduced me to the 80s style of movies, the drop dead stunning beauties Meenakshi Seshadri and Jaya Prada, Amitabh and of course, this brilliant movie!

He realizes that she hates rich people. So Rajveer, along with his family, pretends to be poor to win Madhuri&apos;s love."",""","""We all truly love the simple yet impactful cinema of HRISHIKESH MUKHERJEE without any exception. But at the same time we also somehow believe that its quite hard to re-create the similar kind of ambiance in a film today, due to &apos;the changed world&apos; around us which values things more than our emotions. As a result whenever any such simple meaningful comedy is attempted by a director, it at once gets compared with all those classic, life teaching films from the maestro in an avoidable manner. And since it is extremely difficult to bring that Hrishi Da magic again, the attempt (most of the times) is considered to be pretty weak and average in comparison.\n\nNow the same problem is faced by this week&apos;s AJAB GAZABB LOVE, if you start comparing it with a Hrishikesh Mukherjee film needlessly. But if one can move out of that set parameter of judging (without wearing any logical thinking caps) then the film easily becomes a sweet simple attempt, which can surely be watched once for its emotions, good songs and a lovable act by Darshan Jariwala. Originally a remake of Telugu film SEEMA TAPAKAI (2011), AGL is directed by Sanjay Gadhvi and revolves around the story of a rich boy who plans a scheme to win over a beautiful girl who actually hates the &quot;Rich &amp; the Famous&quot; section of the society.\n\nStarting off with a perfect catchy party number sung by Mika (Boom Boom), the script does have few good sequences both in its first and second half providing the required entertainment to the viewers. But in actual terms AGL manages to hold your attention mainly due to its 4 good songs, a fresh photogenic female lead and few good performances from the cast as required. In fact these are exactly the few factors which eventually save the film from being called a pretty ordinary venture. And with a better climax, different from the present hushed-up one, AGL could have been a much better family film altogether.\n\nNevertheless, along with its melodious soundtrack, AGL needs to be given a chance at least for its enjoyable scenes featuring Darshan Jariwala, Kiron Kher and Arshad Warsi. Where Kiron and Arshad successfully make you smile with their hilarious acts, Darshan Jariwala truly enacts the ironies of life lived by a rich person, unable to cherish the finer things existing around him due to his own chosen lifestyle. Unarguably its one of finest performances by the veteran character actor till date, full of insightful love and emotions deserving praises.\n\nJackyy is surely improving with each new film of his and in AGL he takes one step further looking better. But since the script has too many characters moving on the screen, his sincere efforts get overshadowed unintentionally. Arjun Rampal is fine playing a double role of two brothers who needed a better characterization to be fair. The new entrant Nidhi has got the oomph factor and looks hot on the screen in some chosen outfits reminding you of the beautiful Sangeeta Bijalani of the 80s. She is the same girl who played a small role of a press reporter in OH MY GOD just few weeks back and looked stunning in that too. However Nidhi still needs to work on presenting herself better on the screen as I felt.\n\nThe best feature of the film remain Sajid Wajid, who are in their full form here with four good songs in the soundtrack lead by &quot;Boom Bomm&quot; and &quot;Tu&quot;. Particularly I simply loved the base line in the song &quot;Tu&quot; which is also smartly used in the film&apos;s Background Score. All the tracks are well supported by an eye-catching cinematography and great choreography which don&apos;t really allow you to go out the theater breaking the normal routine.\n\nOn the whole, AJAB GAZABB LOVE works decently due to its Hrishi Da or Frank Capra kind of plot, a pleasing soundtrack and few loving performances. Its not a great or perfect film for sure but a lot better than the usual routine ventures with the big names."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Romance""]","""2012-10-24""","""love""","""1H56M""",10.0

The film shows the many shades of the Hindi film industry both through a fantasy-like perspective (the way Chutki sees it) and a realistic perspective (the way Chutki and Raj experience it) but most of it is done in a subtle way and the humour really balances the tension in the film.\n\nThe triangle love story between Chutki, Raj and the film industry is also wonderfully downplayed. There is no typical &apos;I Love You&apos; scene or a scene where Raj acts out his jealousy. Raj clearly loves Chutki and his principle priority is her happiness. Chutki&apos;s first love is the movies but she eventually grows to love Raj after realizing the sacrifices he has made to make her dream come true.\n\nMakrand Deshpande deserves credit for coming up with the story idea. The multi-dimensional screenplay is very strong. Director Arora has a strength for telling stories about the common people. He has further demonstrated this in the charming &apos;Main, Meri Patni Aur Woh&apos;. Very few directors can tell such stories with conviction.\n\nThe songs are quite well-presented. They&apos;re not used in typical Bollywood fashion. They add to the fantasy element of the film. The cinematography is good too and lighting works brilliantly. The editing crew has done a fine job and the film flows fluidly.\n\nAntara Mali delivers a mind-blowing nuanced performance. She completely owns Chutki and does a fine job of mimicking Madhuri Dixit. The &apos;Madhuri&apos; sequences are suitably brief and Mali gives Chutki a unique personality. Rajpal Yadav is terrific. He conveys Raj&apos;s unconditional love for Chutki with ease and an endearing subtlety. Govind Namdeo shows a flair for comedy as the hilarious agent. The supporting cast is pretty solid.\n\n&apos;Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon!&apos; is another gem produced by the Ram Gopal Verma factory. It has charm. It&apos;s got humour.

When the film begins, Dinanth (Bachchan) is a freedom fighter battling the British for Indian independence. Oddly, only seconds later, India is independent! Now, inexplicably, this well-respected man is ruined by local mobsters--and his wife and daughter are taken from him. He is left with his young son--and no place to live. So, they pack up and move. They settle into a town where mobsters also rule. Oddly, however, as time passes, Dinath&apos;s young son, Raju (ALSO played by Bachchan!!) turns out to be a bit of a bandit himself--and extorts money out of the local mobsters! He&apos;s a real jerk--and he later meets up with a young lady who, inexplicably, gets married to him...of sorts. To see what I mean, see the film...or not!\n\nThe film has too many divergent plots and should have been trimmed a bit. Additionally, although Indians might have accepted Bachchan in dual roles, the idea of someone playing BOTH father and IDENTICAL son is just too stupid for me. I especially loved when Raju dressed up EXACTLY like his father and yet the mobsters didn&apos;t think he was the dad or vice-versa!! Additionally, I just thought Raju was too much of a jerk to care about him or his story. Overall, a pretty dumb film--and a rare misfire for Bachchan."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Comedy"",""Drama""]","""1982-04-23""","""escape,smuggling,slum,leprosy,harmony""","""2H45M""",40.0

They also tell me about this group called &quot;Dot Busters&quot; where they used to shoot women with the dots on their forehead (Indians wearing bindis), but I don&apos;t think they exist anymore.  Anyways, I think one can only enjoy this movie if he/she can relate to it.  How much you like it depends on how much racism you&apos;ve experienced or knowledge you have of such groups.  My geographic location let me enjoy the movie and the fact that I slightly remember how racist my society used to be in the late 80s-early 90s.  However, I am fortunate to say that society seems to be heading in the right direction in respect to racism, so I didn&apos;t have enough experience to like love this movie.\n\nSohail Khan did a good job acting.

He delivered many hits from Deewana to Laadla to Jaan to Jeet and Judaai. Jaan was a successful film at the BO primarily because it was extremely well promoted. I remember how aggressively the film&apos;s producer (Ashok Ghai) and the music company (Tips) played the songs/trailers on almost every channel.\n\nThe story of Jaan reminds me of Ashok Ghaik&apos;s elder brother Subhash Ghai&apos;s smash hit Hero. They are not exactly the same but there is some resemblance. Ajay Devgun&apos;s raw appeal worked in his favor and Twinkle Khanna was a breath of fresh air in this film. The love scenes and drama will seem over the top today, but in 1996 it did seem enjoyable. The comedy was not up to the mark though (Johnny Lever and Priya Arun).\n\nActing wise Ajay Devgun was quite good. He had done similar roles in Vijaypath and Jigar and Divyashakti and well, you get the picture! For her second film, Twinkle Khanna was good. She looked extremely pretty. Vivek Mushran was alright. Amrish Puri was excellent in a role that suited him all the way.\n\nOne of the biggest strengths of the film was its music. Raj Kanwar&apos;s sense of rhythm, Anand-Milind&apos;s gift of melody and Anand Bakshi&apos;s poetic capabilities made Jaan one of the best albums of 1996. The title song was the pick of the lot, but the overall Indian/folksy flavor of the songs ensured that the songs continue to play in the interiors even 20 years later. In fact Subhash Ghai was so impressed with the music of the film that he personally designed the song promos.\n\nRaj Kanwar knew exactly how to direct a film for that time period. He infused all the necessary elements in perfect quantities and made sure that the film was balanced in all respects. Drama was his forte and this film had (over)loads of it. It&apos;s not great cinema but it is surely paisa vasool and entertaining stuff.

A sudden turn of events in the house leaves them astonished. When things worsen, escape seems to be their last resort."",""","""It&apos;s a well known fact that Ram Gopal Verma doesn&apos;t really care about the success or failure of his movies. He has confessed this several times in his interviews that he just moves on when a film gets complete and starts thinking about his next without caring about its good or bad box office result. The attitude is fine till he is able to deliver quality products to his viewers and fans waiting to see each of his new directorial ventures with the same spirits. But if the final outcome of his products keeps receding like his last few projects then that is surely going to hamper his image as well as his fan following which is still hopeful of getting a new masterpiece from the maverick any next Friday.\n\nThe maestro is back with a new sequel to his earlier hit BHOOT released in 2003, but it cannot be called a sequel in the right sense since it neither takes the story further, nor is anywhere close to that well made classic appreciated by both the viewers as well as the critics. In fact BHOOT RETURNS is a very cheap kind of movie, made on a very economical budget and shot on a lower format as RGV&apos;s last release DEPARTMENT. Due to its tricky format, he very smartly avoids extreme close ups or highly flashy scenes in his shots, due to which a common viewer will not be able to guess that its not the usual format he is watching on the screen.\n\nHowever here the problem increases to many folds as not only the format but the film also hasn&apos;t got any solid content which can scare or entertain the viewer in its less than two hours of duration. The story starts in the same manner like many other previous ventures where a family shifts to a new house and then starts experiencing some unusual happenings there. This time RGV also uses few references from the famous PARANORMAL ACTIVITY series movies of the west which perfectly match the lower format of the film quite easily. In the first half he mostly plays with silence and successfully delivers some scary moments through his good old unusual camera placements (perfect for 3D) and the similar kind of frightening soundtrack as used in the original. But post intermission he suddenly gets onto a speedy mode, quickly wraps up the proceeding by killing two kids and then finishes off indicating towards a part three. And due to this, as one moves out, he feels like having watched a long TV Serial episode played in the theater instead of a complete film which just seems like &apos;Cheating&apos;. Performances also fail to make any kind of major impact because of this very reason despite of having some known names such as Manisha Koirala and Chakravarthy (Satya).\n\nSo in business terms, RGV might be able to recover his cost and may also make some profit selling this cheap product at various digital platforms in this cyber age. But what he has really done in BHOOT RETURNS is a sort of scam tried with his own loyal audience by making a fool of them in the theaters and giving them quite less in return of their costly multiplex tickets. Moreover here I have another major point of objection in the movie where RGV has used children killing with knife and being killed (burned) towards the end in quite a disgusting manner.\n\nThe question I want to raise here is that if the Censor and the authorities are so much concerned about showing Child Labour on the streets, Child Smoking on the screen and Exploitation of Kids in Reality Shows then how can they let innocent kids feature in such strong films based on Communal Riots, Ghosts or Brutal killings?\n\nIf Censors cannot allow a child smoking a Cigarette or even holding it in his hands on the screen then how can they let the same child hold a knife and killing someone with all blood around the body in such a cruel manner? In fact acting in such kind of sequences can have a much stronger impact on his or her &apos;still developing&apos; psyche than just smoking a cigarette. Hence personally I strongly don&apos;t appreciate using kids in films dealing with these particular genres. And if the subject really demands a kid to be in it for a solid reason, then it&apos;s the duty of the director to take utmost care of those scenes in particular as they should not leave any kind of long lasting scar on the kid&apos;s psyche, staying for a longer period of time affecting his personal life.\n\nUnfortunately, RGV doesn&apos;t take care of this important fact mentioned above in his BHOOT RETURNS and the film uses the two child actors in its climax quite harshly.\n\nHence you can watch it if you strictly don&apos;t miss any horror film released at regular intervals of the year. But in case you wish to see it only for RGV then you can easily give it a miss since BHOOT RETURNS is just another below average, mediocre flick by the master, which fails to reach his own high standards set in the past."",""reviewRating""","[""Horror"",""Mystery"",""Thriller""]","""2012-10-12""","""horror convention""","""1H25M""",10.0

He soon falls in love with a starlet and loses himself in the intoxicating world of glamour."",""","""Sudhir Mishra&apos;s &apos;Khoya Khoya Chand&apos; is his tribute to the classic Hindifilms of the 1950s-1960s which is considered the golden era of Hindi cinema. It takes at the behind the scenes looks in the lives of actors, writers and filmmakers. It&apos;s not a voyeuristic satire of any sort and though one might notice the references from the lives of Guru Dutt, Waheeda Rehman, Dev Anand, Madhubala, Meena Kumari and even Hollywood stars like Dorothy Dandridge and Marilyn Monroe. The characters themselves are not based on any specific person. The title is derived from a famous song (of the same title) from the 50&apos;s film &apos;Kaala Bazaar&apos;.\n\nI liked Mishra&apos;s attention to detail both as writer and director. The costumes, props, colourful sets, mannerisms of the actors, choreography, the popular classic songs playing in the background and hummed by the actors, contribute very well. The art direction is just superb. Shantanu Moitra, recreates the whimsical jazz style of the 1950&apos;s and the 1960&apos;s which add to the atmosphere. Cinematography is solid, especially the long shots.\n\nThe characters are very well written. Even the supporting characters have a strong presence with little screen time (of course credit goes to the actors as well). Even though the film moves at a slightly slower pace than one prefers, there are several standout moments such as the exchange of glimpse between Nikhat and Ratanbala when Prem Kumar&apos;s engagement is announced. Nikhat catching Zaffar red handed with Ratanbala, the bond between Shyamol and Nikhat after Zafar&apos;s departure....and many more.\n\nSoha Ali Khan is a bit inconsistent in the beginning but she embraces the character as the film proceeds. Perhaps a more experienced actress would have been more suitable for the role. Nonetheless, this is her best performance after &apos;Antarmahal&apos;. Shiny Ahuja is brilliant as the tormented Zafar. Rajat Kapoor is a scene stealer. Ditto Sonia Jehan who is wicked, seductive and vulnerable as the sensual Ratanbala. Vinay Pathak is sublime. Sushmita Mukherjee and Saurabh Shukla provide some comic relief.\n\n&apos;Khoya Khoya Chand&apos; was a visual treat for me and seeing current actors in this period piece made me feel as though I too had moved back in time and was watching a movie sometime in the 1960s. It might not be a film that adhere&apos;s to everyone&apos;s taste but it is a wonderful film to watch.""},""aggregateRating""","[""Drama"",""Romance""]","""2007-12-07""","""meta film""","""2H11M""",15.0

It is not a regular subject in films and to be able to showcase it with such authenticity deserves a lot of credit. Sushil Rajpal tells a story through the characters and situations which look so raw and real. Groom kidnapping was rampant during a period and it adversely impacted the lives of the groom, the bride and more often their families. Marriages are not meant to be forcefully imposed and the tragedy which follows is very well presented here. How the voices of women were suppressed by the male members of her family leading to traumatic experiences for both groom and bride was rightly expressed. Not many film makers will have the guts or creativity to touch this issue makes the film all the more special and unique. However, the film was also predictable in parts which might be because of the anticipation. It definitely touched a chord with a million hearts.

It is a love story involving a young poor, simple and humorous guy named Sunny and a spoilt, bratty rich girl called Roma. Sunny is a hard-working guy who owns a farm-house in a small rural town with his mother; Roma lives in a big mansion, and when her father buys another expansive estate, which happens to be near Sunny&apos;s farm, she eagerly rushes to check their new property. That&apos;s how they meet, and that&apos;s how begins their hate-turns-to-love romance. Little do they know that they were actually once childhood friends, and their parents maintained a close friendship until Sunny&apos;s dad went bankrupt and the families fell apart (a very stupid reason, indeed). The story takes more shape as Roma&apos;s father disapproves of their relationship. While the romantic portions are indeed the main highlight in the story, successfully resting on the youthful and refreshing presence of the two leads, the film has this persistent touch of authenticity that makes everything easy to get involved in.\n\nBeautifully portrayed and filmed, Betaab is benefitted from breathtaking locations and extraordinary, timeless songs composed by R. D. Burman. Songs like &quot;Jab Hum Jawan Hoge&quot;, &quot;Apne Dil Se Badi&quot; and &quot;Badal Yun&quot; are unforgettable. Where acting goes, Sunny Deol and Amrita Singh, both highly appealing, perform convincingly in their debut roles, and Shammi Kapoor and Nirupa Roy provide great support. Deol in particular is outstanding in his natural simplicity and easygoing sophistication. Betaab is a charming love story which has comedy, drama and action, and many sequences in it were enjoyable and quite fun to watch while there were also several touching moments. I might not have liked everything about this film, but I loved it for its engaging simplicity and for capturing so well the calm beauty of the rural parts of India, achieved with appropriate sets and efficiently aided by the many different and lovely animals, including Sunny&apos;s livestock and particularly his cute pet dog. This is a heartwarming film and according to me one of the better Hindi love stories of the 1980s."",""reviewRating""","[""Family"",""Romance""]","""1983-08-05""","""love,childhood sweetheart,battle of the sexes,snake bite,lead actor&apos;s first film""","""2H42M""",39.0

Murders and shooting scenes(always present in such a movie)are there. The songs of the movie are pretty good and the movie is not expectable. Some of the things, which were expected, did not happen. This makes the movie better than most of the Indian stuff being released nowadays, and this difference, I believe will greatly contribute to the betterment of Indian movies.

But a few sloppy mistakes in the film simply shouldn&apos;t have been there. First, the sound was very poor....sounding like many of the actors were performing in a closet. I have no idea why, but the leading man was dubbed by someone else. Second, in a scene early in the movie a doctor is yelling for blood donors...saying he needed type AB+ blood (which is pretty rare). I am not a doctor but I know folks with AB+ blood can also receive O+, B+ or A+ blood....pretty much most people actually. Third, late in the movie, the hero thinks he&apos;s being followed and when he looks behind him, a dark car is behind him on a divided highway....but when seen from any other direction, the road is NOT divided. Sloppy stuff. Yet despite some sloppy work here and there, the movie is still excellent....and you should see it.\n\nZaid (Muzammil Ibrahim) is an excellent cop and you can see this as he&apos;s investigating a terror bombing. But despite doing a great job with both Hindu and Muslim suspects, he soon finds himself a suspect as well! Why? Becauses his wife, it turns out, was the bomber! Zaid could not accept this and is shocked when he&apos;s taken into police custody and grilled. When they decide he&apos;s innocent, he&apos;s still mistrusted and hated...and he&apos;s determined to not only prove his innocence but find out why his wife did such a horrible thing.\n\nI wonder how this film played in India. This is because the film not only attacks jihadists but also looks at how unjust police actions often spawn these terror bombers. And, the ending seemed a bit idealistic. But the film had a lot to say and said it very well...and left you feeling that perhaps this cycle might be broken one day.

Mr. Kalakaar! ,tt1695793,Manasvi,"""The only daughter of a wealthy businessman falls in love with a middle-classed underemployed artist."",""","""It is a very common sight in today&apos;s tech savvy world when the Old Age people refuse to understand or learn about all the newly introduced electronic gadgets and just want to be as they are. In reality they either have a fear of not being able to understand the new things or they are just not willing to bow down to the changing trends due to their own reputation or ego. And that&apos;s exactly the case with Rajshri Productions Team, which refuses to bring in or adopt the new young styles of film-making in their own projects. As a result almost all their recent releases have failed to make an impact on the new-age audience and the current LOVE U MR. KALAKAAR is also not an exception to that outcome.\n\nThe storywriter (also the director) has written a script taking his clues from the decades old bollywood plot of a love affair between a rich girl and poor boy. And therefore the audience feels &apos;The Yawn&apos; right in the first few minutes of the film knowing its basic storyline. I wonder how this kind of highly outdated script was approved by the Production house in the first place. And then spending a whole lot of money on making a complete new film with some young known faces was further even more surprising.\n\nLUMK revolves around all superficial kind of characters who are too good to be real. The typical Indian Traditional values, the helping people with the changed hearts, the highly principled characters, and the innocent love between the lead pair, everything is there in the film as the trademark feature of a Rajshri product. However the only new addition in the script is the profession of Tusshar Kapoor who happens to be a Cartoonist i.e. a Kalakaar. But other than that, all the supposed to be new scenes of a love couple sitting in the company&apos;s board room and trying to raise some big profits look childish. In fact it also seems to be funny when Amrita teaches Tusshar-the Kalakaar, the basic principles of business with the help of his colours and other tricks.\n\nMusically the soundtrack is pretty ordinary with no particular worth remembering track in the film. Moreover the songs are only there because as per the Old School rule book, there cannot be a Bollywood movie made without some love and dance sequences. Similarly in the performance department too, you can&apos;t expect a lot from the actors when they have got nothing new to portray on the screen as per the script given to them. Therefore, no complaints from the star-cast as such. But yes, Amrita Rao should essentially work on her looks and dress codes because sometimes her beauty really gets ruined by the awful dresses she wears.\n\nIn all, LOVE U MR. KALAKAAR is just another weak project coming from the reputed house of Rajshri Films. And the reason why it once again fails to make an impact is that Rajshri refuses to move away from its fixed pattern."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama"",""Romance""]","""2011-05-13""","""love""","""2H32M""",11.0

His female lead was a bit weak though, but she improves as the movie progressess.  The fight scenes are superb and i applaud Arjun&apos;s efforts.  Anyone who says that this supermodel, turned actor cannot act, has to see this movie and revise that opinion.\n\nArjun is a definite star of the future.

The governess of the ageing billionaire Mrs. Khambatta (Lillete Dubey) dies under mysterious circumstances. Her financial manager Pat (Gautam Rode) is asked to fill the vacancy immediately. Sheena Roy (Zareen Khan) is hired for the job. Despite Khambatta wanting an elderly lady, Pat manages to convince her to give Sheena a chance. However, the job doesn&apos;t come easy for Sheena. Pat asks her to sleep with him if she wants to retain the job. Sheena needs the job desperately and also to support her boyfriend Ricky (Abhinav Shukla) who is facing financial crunch. Hence, Sheena submits to Pat&apos;s advances. But suddenly things go wrong for Pat. Sheena shares secrets about Khambatta&apos;s will that gives Pat&apos;s sleepless nights. What happens next forms the rest of the film.\n\nAKSAR 2&apos;s biggest problem is that it&apos;s dated in all respects. Director Ananth Narayan Mahadevan seems to be stuck in the 90s and hence, the film fails to impress. The first half is still bearable as one hopes that the story might take an intriguing and exciting turn. But the film falls completely flat in the second half. The entire plan made by Sheena and her gang doesn&apos;t make any sense. It&apos;s bewildering why Bachchan Singh (Mohit Madaan) gets involved in the whole madness when he was not going to get even a single rupee. Just to surprise viewers and add twists, the film goes in a total nonsense zone. In fact, the climax is difficult to comprehend and doesn&apos;t make an iota of sense.\n\nNarendra Bajaj&apos;s story is silly. Sanjeev Puri&apos;s screenplay is unexciting. A suspense thriller needs to be engaging and gripping. AKSAR 2, however is slow and replete with insipid moments. Sanjeev Puri&apos;s dialogues however are fine at places.\n\nAnanth Narayan Mahadevan&apos;s direction is dated and doesn&apos;t hold any appeal either for the multiplex audiences or even for the single screen audiences. The film is majorly promoted as an erotica but even the sex scenes are very few and far between. It&apos;s shocking that on one hand, the director shines with films like GOUR HARI DASTAAN, DOCTOR RAKHMABAI, MEE SIDHUTAI SAPKAL etc and on the other hand, he makes a mockery of himself with THE XPOSE and now AKSAR 2.\n\nZareen Khan is strictly okay and though she is sizzling, it&apos;s done just for the heck of it. She tries to be the female Emraan Hashmi but it doesn&apos;t work for her. Performance-wise, she doesn&apos;t give her best shot. Gautam Rode looks dashing but his performance leaves a lot to be desired. He&apos;s shockingly hardly there in the second half. Abhinav Shukla tries too hard and looks too stylish for his character. Mohit Madaan is the best of the lot, especially when his character gets prominence. Lillete Dubey is decent. S Sreesanth (Gaurav), Rushad Rana (banker) and Denzil Smith (assassin) are strictly alright.\n\nMithoon&apos;s music is nothing special and might have worked if it was used in some other, better film. &apos;Jaana Ve&apos; and &apos;Aaj Zid&apos; are incorporated to cater to the frontbenchers as it has loads of sex. &apos;Tanhaiyaan&apos; appears in the second half and is forcefully put in the film. It looks very odd because the character is imagining having sex with a dead person and also crying since he&apos;s no more! Background score however has the thrill-feel.\n\nManeesh Bhatt&apos;s cinematography is fair but one can make out that the airport and monorail scenes have been shot using digital camera or Go Pro and it is quite visible. Allan Amin&apos;s action is average. Muneesh Suppel&apos;s production design is rich while Jeetendra Shah&apos;s editing is fine.\n\nOn the whole, AKSAR 2 is a poor show all the way. It neither has enough sex nor thrill."",""reviewRating""","[""Crime"",""Drama"",""Mystery""]","""2017-11-17""","""murder,revenge,strangulation,attempted strangulation,man strangles woman""","""2H7M""",5.0

But, the germs of it being the first film of a director under Rituparno&apos;s tutelage can be made out after one has gone through a considerable portion of the film. Excepting these discussions, what we glean from movie is a so-called aberrant sexuality which, it says, is not to be looked down upon by the fortunate heterosexuals of this world. Arati (Deepti Naval) - the mother, finding it hard to come to terms with and to switch her emotions between her son&apos;s sudden death and his homosexuality hitherto unknown to her - at first detests Ornub (Rituparno), but subsequently starts cherishing his company taking him to be her dead son&apos;s &apos;special&apos; someone or her another alive son. Another relation, between Sahana (Raima Sen) and Arati, is also a very pleasant one founded on honesty and respect. Arati, during her short stay at her dead son&apos;s house, learns about certain grim truths about this world which, heretofore even her grey hair has not shown her. When she leaves, she leaves with a bagful of warm closeness she has unknowingly amassed within these few days from both Ornub and Sahana and leaves behind with them &apos;a bit of&apos; herself and her dead son. The background melody and the nominal songs accentuate the situations.

But many times we have seen this going the wrong way, which exactly is the problem with &quot;Aagey Se Right&quot;. With a one line thick story thought and a terrible messy screenplay the movie doesn&apos;t deserve to be called a comedy.\n\nA newly appointed Cop loses his service revolver right in the start and then keeps on moving from one situation to another in search of his lost property. Along with this, there is another angle of a Jihadi terrorist falling in love with a young girl, looking for a break in the show business. The promising idea which may have worked in a 90 min English movie gets completely wasted in the Bollywood style project. The reason being that we are still forced to add more additional sub-plots and unwanted songs into the screenplay which actually spoils a good thought and results in an unpleasant clutter.\n\nHad it been only these two plots moving into each other, the movie could have been an engrossing flick. But the overcrowded characters running with their own parallel story lines didn&apos;t work out at all leading to a complete disaster. The director along with his talented star cast tries desperately hard to make you laugh, but there are actually only few scenes in the movie where you can even smile effortlessly. The screenplay keeps wandering like a lost car on a road moving left and right without any specific directions to go.\n\nWith Kay Kay &amp; Shreyas Talpade being there in the cast, the movie was expected to be at least a watchable attempt for once. But surprisingly, even they are unable to perform in their unexciting and loosely scattered scenes written uninterestingly. Kay Kay seems to be miscast and Shreyas fails to create any laughter with his innocent attempts. In fact there is only one person, who proves his comic timing once again and he is Vijay Maurya, the Mumbai underworld link of the terrorists. He is really amusing in his few scenes along with Kay Kay. Among the ladies, Shehnaz Treasurywala is simply there because of her pretty face and I really don&apos;t know what was Mahi Gill doing in this movie after her impressive performances in &quot;Dev-D&quot; &amp; &quot;Gulaal&quot;. It was clearly a wrong choice made in an important phase of her career. Shiv Pandit &amp; Shruti Seth don&apos;t impress, but the veterans Rakesh Bedi and Bharti Achrekar excel in their small parts.\n\nMusically, the movie has nothing to offer great and same can be said about its Cinematography and Background Score. Editing is unimpressive as it leaves many loose ends remaining unexplained. The movie should have been edited more severely removing all the non essential scenes like that of Shreyas mother coming again &amp; again into the narration.\n\nDirector Indrajit Nattoji has surely made this movie with good intentions, keeping it clean and tidy for the family audiences. But he couldn&apos;t deliver a highly enjoyable comedy despite of having the support of a big production house. However the biggest positive point I see in these small budget experimental types of movies is that they provide an opportunity to many budding technicians, music directors and lyricists who want to prove themselves in the industry. But in case of &quot;Aagey Se Right&quot;, its posters are far better than the movie, so you can easily give it a miss."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Crime"",""Drama""]","""2009-09-04""","""police,terrorist,threatened with a pistol,thick accent,terrorist plot""","""1H57M""",13.0

This film by Mahesh Mathai is about this disaster. While it could have focused on many people, the movie focuses on one man in particular, a worker at the plant. You see the death, suffering, cover-up and indifference through his eyes and his realization that his beloved employer is at fault---and amazingly indifferent.\n\nThe most amazing thing about the film is that the director, Mathai, has only directed one other film. I tried to get more information on him on IMDb and other sites but couldn&apos;t really find much. And, considering how good &quot;Bhopal Express&quot; is, it&apos;s just amazingly strange that you don&apos;t see more Mathai films. Additionally, the acting was very good--with a wonderful emotional range--such that you really do care about him, his friends and his bride.\n\nI noticed that some found the film to be a disappointment. This isn&apos;t very surprising, as the event has touched so many lives that you know many will feel that &quot;Bhopal Express&quot; doesn&apos;t adequately convey the misery and magnitude of the tragedy. Still, especially for westerners who know far less about the Bhopal disaster, it&apos;s a good introduction and puts a human face on the people.\n\nBy the way, there is one minor complaint about the DVD and that is that the captions blend in with the background and are occasionally difficult to read. Hopefully your copy will have more readable captions."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama""]","""1999-12-02""","""disaster,train,railway platform,poisonous gas,freeze frame""","""1H40M""",23.0

The pregnant elder sister of the heroine Anupama (Bipasha Basu) and her brother-in-law were in the WTC and talking over to phone to herself when the terrorist plane struck the building and both got killed alongwith several others in that attack.\n\nThat mishap had a severe adverse effect on the heart and mind of Anupama and a kind of hatred started developing in her somewhere deep down the surface of her subconscious. After a couple of years, Anupama, doing a painting course, gets engaged to Arpit (Priyanshu Chatterjee) who is the son of the friend of her father. However shortly thereafter, she comes across a stranger - Aman (John Abraham) who calls himself as the member of an anti-terrorist organization. She, being attracted to him due to his mission and his daredevil profession, keeps on meeting him at his residence. This interaction of Anupama and so-called Aman covers several things and has several facets.\n\nAfter some time, when the issue of Anupama&apos;s marriage with Arpit arises, she refuses saying that she&apos;s in love with Aman. But Aman is nowhere. Nobody can see him except Anupama. Nobody can hear him except Anupama. But being a painting student, Anupama has made many sketches of Aman&apos;s persona. Now Arpit is in a fix. Everybody says that Aman does not exist but the sketches say that he exists at least for Anupama. Being deeply in love with Anupama since they first met, Arpit decides to do something for Anupama who is going lunatic, being considered schizophrenic and being forcibly given psychiatric treatment with confinement in an asylum. What he does and what finally turns out due to his endeavours is the remaining part of the story which is completely unbelievable.\n\nThe movie entertains and engrosses the viewer in the first half which is very well directed. Just watch this movie without prejudices and you won&apos;t get bored even for a moment in the pre-interval session. The trouble comes with the advent of the post-interval session whose screenplay could not be written interestingly. The scenes of Anupama in the asylum are very difficult to tolerate and the climax involving the plastic surgery issue is a complete letdown leaving a feeling of having been cheated in the viewer. The final scene, unfortunately, reduces the whole movie to a laughing stock.\n\nDespite the profoundness of the subject and the treatment given to it, the movie presents healthy comedy also in its first half. The painting class scenes involving Anupama and her close friend Shabnam (Shweta Tiwari) as well as the scenes of the first meeting of Anupama and Arpit and thereafter Arpit&apos;s remembering her while being in his home are no less than laugh-riots. And they are able to generate plenty of laughs sans any use of vulgarity which is a very commendable thing in my opinion.\n\nBipasha Basu has performed excellently and turned her unusual role into a believable one. Both John Abraham and Priyanshu Chatterjee have done well. TV actress Shweta Tiwari has got a meaty role and she has generated ample laughs for the audience by her innocent mannerisms. The complete supporting cast is well in place.\n\nThis movie does not appear to be a copy of another known Indian or foreign movie to me (inspiration might have been there though). However the theme of this movie appears to have inspired a Hindi movie that came a couple of years after this movie. That much acclaimed and commercially successful movie is Lage Raho Munna Bhai (2006). Believe it or not, the basic grains of both these movies are the same though on surface they appear to be entirely different stuffs.\n\nThe way Anupama&apos;s illusion of seeing Aman in Madhoshi has a sound and logical basis, the same way Munna&apos;s illusion of seeing Mahatma Gandhi in Lage Raho Munna Bhai has a sound and logical basis. The way Anupama is not believed by anyone and taken to psychiatric treatment by others (because none else is able to see or hear Aman), the same way Munna is not believed by others and taken to a psychiatrist (because none else is able to see or hear Mahatma Gandhi). However I don&apos;t think that anybody other than myself has noticed this subtle similarity of the basic premise between both these movies. Lage Raho Munna Bhai is termed as a movie based on the Gandhian principles and rightly so. This is an example how the same story idea can either be developed into a great movie or wasted. Rajkumar Hirani could do with this idea in Lage Raho Munna Bhai what Tanveer Khan could not in Madhoshi.\n\nDespite the fact that Madhoshi not only badly flopped but also was torn apart by the viewers and the reviewers alike, I am recommending it because I like it and despite flaws, do not consider it as something like trash. Since Lage Raho Munna Bhai was a huge box office hit and got great critical acclaim as well, I advise those who have seen Lage Raho Munna Bhai to watch Madhoshi and contrast these two movies in terms of the basic story idea."",""reviewRating""","[""Musical"",""Mystery"",""Drama""]","""2004-09-24""","""sex,one word title""","""2H2M""",18.0

It is especially disappointing coming from Mr. Bachchan, a great actor who happens to be an impressively intelligent man, who I can&apos;t believe was not aware of how pathetic everything here looks.\n\nBachchan gets another opportunity to play a hero, the problem is that being a hero in commercial Hindi films was only preserved for action films, preferably bad action films. And this one is indeed it. We see an aging star fighting with great energy dozens of goons, and it really wavers between funny and a little embarrassing. He reminds one of Leslie Nielsen in The Naked Gun. But this is not a comedy, not an intentional at least, and Bachchan is a great actor, which makes the entire thing the more unwatchable.\n\nBut Bachchan is really not bad. He does well in moments where he is required to act. He is just miscast, and it&apos;s not the same thing. He does play a man closer to his age, but he also gets to play the younger version of it, and that&apos;s where the problem. Cast opposite him is Dimple Kapadia, whose radiant energy early on is wonderful just as her outbursts later on are strangely overdone. What made an actor of her stature do this film is a mystery.

For instance, if a film starts with a pleasant family atmosphere where everyone is smiling at each other, there is Bhajan being sung at an in- house Puja Ghar with the idols of Ram Seeta &amp; Lakshman, the first half goes on with no story development at all, a conflict arises just before the intermission, the rest of the film has a feeble plot with an important message for a society and essentially if Mohnish Behl is there in a key rolethen the film is definitely a product of Rajshri Movies without any exception.\n\nAs expected, ISI LIFE MEIN also suffers from the same above mentioned Rajshri Syndrome, which urgently needs to be looked upon by the people associated with the banner. The film is simply shot and weakly written having few average performances from the cast, which are incapable of making any kind of impact on the viewers. Moreover the music, which always has been an important quality part of a Rajshri product, is also below par this time which further acts as a major letdown for the venture.\n\nThe first half has everything going on in a pleasant manner which clearly indicates that something wrong will only happen towards the intermission. But against all the expectations the second half too keeps on moving at the same pace and the real plot only crops up in the last half an hour, which also fails to register. With such a lazy and uninteresting script, having all seen before kind of content, I don&apos;t know why the reputed production house gave its green signal to this product in the first place.\n\nThe only likable feature of the movie remains its leading pair, who look pretty on the screen especially Sandeepa Dhar in the role of cultured girl with all the Indian Values. She acts pretty well and also looks gorgeous on the screen in both western and Indian attires. Akshay Oberoi too has got the talent and looks but he somehow scores less in comparison to his leading lady. Salman Khan making a cameo for a few seconds is wasted whereas Mohnish Behl has got the same old expressions to show in all those emotional scenes. Similarly the rest of the cast also acts exactly like you have already seen in many previous Rajshri Movies. Therefore there in no freshness or novelty in the treatment given by the director Vidhi Kasliwal to the film, which ideally could have been much shorter than its present length? In fact, the director should have ended the movie right after the marriage sequence in the climax as per the need of the subject.\n\nHaving said that, I would like to praise Rajshri people for their noble intentions of making films which always have some important social messages to give to their viewers. Following their valuable tradition, ISI LIFE MEIN too has TWO important messages for the society, pointing towards the concept of modernism and the ages old dowry issue still prevalent in our modern civilization.\n\nAs its first message the film tries to explain that a modern person doesn&apos;t necessarily mean a person far away from his traditional values and customs. In other words its always possible that a person may be modern along with having the same rich culture and traditions in his heart which in turn enables him to lead a much better life than the West.\n\nSecondly, the film talks about the still to be tackled Dowry issue in our society from a different angle never touched before. Moving away from the usual stuff, the story here emphasis more on the father of the girl, who with a heavy heart, always agrees to the greedy demands of dowry, for the sake of his own image in the society and relations. Instead of pointing the finger towards the dowry demanding families, the film asks an important question to the girl&apos;s father that, &quot;How can you even think of throwing your own daughter in the clutches of such greedy people and that too with all that glamorous show off? Why can&apos;t a father just refuse such a ridiculous demand and wait for the right kind of families to make a relation with?\n\nAnd as an answer to this question, the film has a sequence where Mohnish Behl himself stops the marriage of his own daughter and asks her would be in-laws to simply leave with his folded handsThe act really needs to be followed by every father of a girl in our society, since it&apos;s the girl who later suffers severely till her last breath and yet cannot complain.\n\nHence, though ISI LIFE MEIN has got nothing in it as a movie experience, but as a social venture it does have a great message for our younger generation and their future. So you may give it a chance but only after it gets released on the Home Video after few weeks.\n\nIn the end, along with reviewing the movie here, I would strongly like to oppose this ugly one sided practice (Dowry System) of our society through this platform of my site and I hope my readers would also try their own bit to fight this unwanted curse imposed upon us from decades."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Drama"",""Romance""]","""2010-12-24""","""girl""","""2H19M""",12.0

Indian Army&apos;s (the desi servicemen of course) moral support over the trial of 3 INA officers followed by the mutiny of Royal Indian Navy in the same year 1946, made the British Raj realise that they would not be able to hold the administration &amp; defense anymore which were mostly been served by Indians - Police, Army, Navy etc under the commands of British officials.\n\nAs a movie it stands out fair, specially to maintain historical accuracy and showcasing the limited awareness of mass for the INA activities till the trial started. Also it has successfully portrayed the roles of patriotic bureaucrats, who may not have marched the streets against British bullets but fought the administration from within. And the movie also quite truthfully shows, patriotism is not everyone&apos;s stick to keep it high, especially under government oppression where patriotism demands ultimate sacrifices both financially and physically, unlike the social network brawl these days. Not every captured soldier was convinced enough to get dragged into another battle they knew was quite impossible to win, and even when they volunteered, not everyone could walk till the end. That does not make them &apos;anti national&apos; - but like any other fellow countryman who could not participate in anti British movements or like us who cannot rise up and resist every wrong doing around us because of the desire to have normal family life and live it.\n\nAlthough its filmed in a documentary style, Raag Desh never drags at any point. The courtroom remains intense, flashback events are crisp and relevant, pacing is thorough. All the lead characters are quite believable, Amit Sadh deserves a special mention though. Music is one of the section where I felt it should have been compelled more powerfully and less melodic. &apos;Tumhe Namaami&apos; is a fine track though. Action is the other section I was let down quite a bit.

She flits between glamorous professions, working as an executive in a five-star hotel, and also as a popular model of the Mumbai advertising world. Yet her traditi..."",""","""I had read somewhere that being in love with someone is a great thing because it makes you feel alive. Joggers Park confirms the statement. It is not about the Joggers&apos; Park situated in Bandra West, Mumbai. It is about two joggers who come to know each other by meeting there and the life changes for both of them.\n\nThere is an old Hindi movie song whose one stanza says - NA UMR KI SEEMA HO, NA JANM KA HO BANDHAN, JAB PYAR KARE KOI TO DEKHE KEWAL MANN (In love, there is no bar of age or birth as a lover sees only the heart of the beloved). And Joggers Park is a beautifully told saga which underscores this saying in a highly emphatic manner.\n\nA retired judge comes across a working girl, half his age in the Joggers Park. The girl is outspoken, lovely, confident and emotional. Interacting with her leads the aged man of principals who is a stern patriarch in his family, to have the feeling of the melting of the paraffin. A whole new world of emotions, interactions and social life opens before the aged gentleman who has never happened to see anything outside the court-room, the legal files and his traditional joint family. The girl, on the other hand, too gets more and more fascinated to the mature and benevolent nice person who sometimes becomes possessive towards her like a kid. However, ultimately both come to realise that this relationship, howsoever satisfying it might be, has not future and the society will not allow it to be made public. On the girl&apos;s side, the need of social security gets the better of her love and on the male&apos;s side, his responsibility towards his family overpowers his deep and delicate sentiments towards the girl. But the touchy last scene of the movie reminds the viewer that the thread of love cannot be broken by distance of the involving individuals.\n\nThe débutant director late Mr. Anant Balani has done a terrific job. He has handled the sensitive and delicate theme of the movie with utmost maturity. The film has its flaws and lean patches, yet the overall impact of the movie upon a sensitive viewer is nothing short of a marvel. The biggest plus point, in my opinion, of the movie is that while treating the plot, the director has lent utmost respect to the central characters. Whether or not, you approve the relationship between the lead pair, you cannot help yourself respecting them. They are never short of dignity. The supporting cast has also been shown in respectful light and the story teller is very much correct in not exposing the scandalous affair and giving a different and highly mature end to the story.\n\nThe characters are purely the flesh and blood human-beings. Nobody appears to be a fake character. Every main sequence of the movie has a human face. The human side of the two protagonists as well as the family members of the judge is revealed and emphasized with elegance. After all, loving somebody is not a sin and all emotional male-female relationships are not destined for the wedlock. But then, does this fact reduce the importance of the relationship or the sentiments involved ? No ! Declares the story teller. The relationship between the loving couple has been shown as purely platonic. They enjoy each-other&apos;s company, they respect each-other, they care for each-other and they strive to see and listen to each-other. But ! Nowhere is there any element of sensuality. And that shows the director&apos;s better sense and mature handling of a love story of a 65 years&apos; old retired judge and a 32 years&apos; old working girl.\n\nThe musical score is pretty good though repeating the Adnan Saami song again and again in the background, irritates. The ghazal of Jagjeet Singh - Badi Najuk Hai Yeh Manzil is nothing short of a treat for the melody lovers. The cinematography is good. The loving couple is seen several times near the sea which (perhaps) symbolises the depth of their relationship. Other technical aspects are also upto the mark. The movie is lengthy but it is not a minus point because to portray the evolution of the relationship properly, the narrator needed time.\n\nThe lead pair has delivered towering performances. Victor Banerjee has not done many Hindi films but he an actor of the genre of Nasiruddin Shah, Girish Karnad and Om Puri and since his early days of Shyam Benegal&apos;s Kalyug in 1981, he has seldom disappointed with his performance. The kid like feeling and behaviour of Justice J.P. Chatterjee who is in his sixties, has been excellently portrayed by him, giving the relevant scenes of the movie, an utterly human look. Perizaad Zorabian, on the other hand is not only pretty but a highly efficient actress who has portrayed the sentimental but daring and confident Jennie so well that it is difficult to imagine any other actress in that role. Among other cast which has got cameos only, Divya Dutta as the straight-talking and mirror showing daughter and Abha Dhuliya as the completely traditional and never suspecting her husband, devoted housewife are excellent.\n\nWhy do we use the term - falling in love ? Falling itself is a negative term. In love, a person rises, not falls. Even when you are already committed, being in love with someone does not make you a sinner. After all, love just happens. It is not something deliberately attempted. The thing that constrains the expression and advancement of such feelings is called MARYAADA or the behavioural boundary-line associated to a person&apos;s status in the social life. Indian culture and the Indian social set-up put family honour and social repute of an individual on top of his priority list. And love is meant for sacrifice. Isn&apos;t it ? See Joggers Park and realise yourself."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama"",""Romance""]","""2003-09-12""","{""total"":0","""2H13M""",19.0

And other works are just embarrassing failures (e.g., his adaptation of Ibsen&apos;s An Enemy of the People.)  By coincidence, I saw Sadgati at the same festival and on the same day as Enemy of the People, and thus witnessed within hours the very worst and the very best of Ray.  As for Sadgati, I don&apos;t know how to overpraise it.  Made for TV, it is a brutally ironic condemnation of the Indian caste system and, by extension, all inequality and injustice.  It has the concentrated power of a story from Russian literature.  (Tolstoy would have loved it.)  The cruel directness of this work displays an unexpected aspect of Ray&apos;s genius.

But sadly, the exciting mystery dies in just few minutes into the film, when Amit turns out to be nothing but another version of Mr. Yogi looking for a perfect girl with some specific qualities written in his so called list. And the moment this fact gets revealed, you feel like saying, Oh Not Again please!\n\nFrankly post Ashutosh Gowariker&apos;s big debacle &amp; many other projects made on this identical concept, it was really strange to see that such kind of boring and routine script was approved by the makers quite ignorantly. Or probably it was done by few persons who are well aware of many popular Hollywood rom-coms made in the west but haven&apos;t seen our own Indian projects made with the similar themes in the past as it seems. Anyway in short the story of the film can be described in these indicative pointers beginning with one Mr. Yogi, his list of qualities to find in a girl, meeting a girl who has nothing out of the list but likable, beginning of a sweet relationship, entry of another gorgeous business women, a quick second affair, then break up and that too with a break up consultant, return to the original girl realizing the true love and that&apos;s it.\n\nEnacting this rotten storyline Vir Das tries to play his part of a new age Mr. Yogi as if it is something epic being made, speaking right into the camera (conversing with the audience) taking the straight clue from Kavin Spacey in HOUSE OF CARDS Series. The girls visibly prove that this one of their first projects got by chance and the actor playing Vir&apos;s close friend poses to be another Love Guru without any impact. Above all there is a pug featuring in the film too named Noni Singh and that should say a lot about the mindsets behind the project to be honest.\n\nThe cinematography, background score &amp; art direction tries to give it a young feel in a very uninteresting manner and once the secret of Amit Sahni&apos;s List is out, the film becomes a continuous drag towards the end along with many mediocre songs, which might sound OK to many youngsters as a soundtrack unrelated to the film. \n\nIn short, it&apos;s really weird to see that the directors are not willing to take up some novel concepts in their films made without any big star cast. Because in reality that remains the only way, they can make their presence felt in front of the other big projects marketed so well. And since AMIT SAHNI KI LIST doesn&apos;t offer anything fresh in its content or execution, therefore you can easily give it a miss to catch up later at any channel in the coming months. But that too along with performing some kind of creative multitasking for sure, since the film seriously doesn&apos;t deserve your complete attention."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Romance""]","""2014-07-18""","{""total"":0","""1H50M""",8.0

Aazaan also has been given the task of finding his missing brother who is believed to be linked with terrorists.\n\nThe concept is weak-something that people nowadays are not very interested in.The editing is poor, for some scenes there is audio video mismatch(poor dubbing).

Upon arrival he is received by his friend, Happy Singh, who arranges for his accommodation with stern..."",""","""Pardesi Babu (gentleman coming from outside the place) is a rom-com in its pre-interval session which turns into a love triangle in its post-interval session. The Pardesi Babu of this movie is Raju (Govinda) who migrates from his village to Mumbai to make it big in his life. He comes across runaway bride who is actually a rich girl being married against her will. She is Cheeni (Shilpa Shetty). Soon, both fall in love. However as usually happens in the life of lovers, the difference in status becomes a wall between Cheeni and Raju. Cheeni&apos;s father (Rajeev Verma) agrees to marry Cheeni to Raju upon the condition of his earning a sum of Rs. one crore in the span of one year. Raju gets disappointed but all of a sudden he finds a suitcase containing a sum of Rs. 10 lakh. Now he feels that he can meet the condition put up by Cheeni&apos;s father and get the love of his life.\n\nHe moves to Darjeeling with his friend and associate Happy Singh (Satish Kaushik) to buy a tea estate and manufacture tea in line with the formula devised by an unsupported scientist (Veerendra Saxena). Here he comes into contact with Karuna (Raveena Tandon) whose father (Deepak Qazir) has gone insane after failing to get his daughter married. Gradually the proximity of Raju and Karuna increases and one day Raju comes to know of something he was hitherto unaware of. That knowledge throws him into severe guilt-complex and instead of returning to Cheeni and her father after one year (he has met the condition of earning Rs. one crore), he decides to marry Karuna. However, Cheeni reaches Darjeeling as Raju did not return as per the information given by him through a letter. Karuna and Cheeni happen to meet and both of them come to know of the fact that the man of their dreams is common. This love-triangle gets resolved in the climax after Raju faces the charge of theft of money belonging to Cheeni&apos;s father whereas the real culprit is Narendra (Mohnish Behl).\n\nThis movie is an entertaining one with all the regular Bollywood formulae of ill-treatment of the lead character by his stepmom, his migrating to the city to make it big in the life, romance, comedy, songs and dances, villain&apos;s conspiracies, fights etc. available because the hero of this movie - Govinda was considered Jack of All in his heyday. Other than his marvellous comic timing, he could romance, he could dance, he could fight, he could emote; there&apos;s nothing beyond his reach as far as entertaining the audience was concerned. He was indeed the biggest entertainer of Hindi cinema for around a decade, being recognized as the uncrowned comedy king of Bollywood. This movie came when his magic was waning. However he has left no stone unturned in entertaining the spectator of this movie by his all-round performance supported by a reasonably good script.\n\nThe comedy-soaked first half of this movie is actually the build-up for its emotion-packed second half, especially the climax. The highlight as well as the best part of this movie is its climax only containing the emotional outburst of Govinda underscoring the fact that in today&apos;s materialistic world, money is considered supreme and given precedence over anything and everything. He asks the same question whether money can take the place of the values and virtues of life. Should the things like Shiv Ki Shakti, Meera Ki Bhakti, Krishna Ki Bansi, Koyal Ki Taan etc. etc. etc. be considered as lacking that special something that is contained by money only. He expresses the deep-seated pain in his heart by telling to all and sundry present there (the marriage venue) that his (step)mother&apos;s hatred was better than the love of them all and asserts to go back to his village (in Raj Kapoor&apos;s style - Hum To Jaate Apne Gaaon, Apni Raam Raam Raam). That&apos;s a stunning emotional performance by him. Mesmerizing ! Unforgettable ! \n\nExcept Mohnish Behl whose talent has been spoiled by most of the directors of Bollywood, all the characters including Shilpa Shetty, Raveena Tandon, Satish Kaushik, Deepak Qazir, Veerendra Saxena, Rajeev Verma, Avtar Gill, Aasif Sheikh etc. have delivered up to the mark performances. And Govinda ? He&apos;s simply outstanding.\n\nThe beauty of the tea-gardens of Darjeeling has been spread very well in the screen (during the post-interval session). Some comedy sequences during the first half appear to be forced into the narrative, else the director has not allowed the length of the movie to go beyond the reasonable limit. Choreography and action aspects are also in order. Background score is satisfactory according to the changing moods of the movie throughout its duration.\n\nMusical score prepared by Anand Raj Anand is satisfactory. It Happens Only In India was a chartbuster song when this movie was released. However in my view, the best song of this album is Kuchh Khona Hai Kuchh Paana Hai, Jeevan Ka Khel Puraana Hai. Jaave Sajna Main Nahin Karna Tera Aitbaar is also a good sentimental song. Other songs are all right. I feel that the songs are too many and a couple of songs could have been done away with.\n\nPardesi Babu was a flop and brushed aside by the reviewers too. However since I liked it, I recommend it as an entertaining flick not only to the fans of Govinda but the movie buffs in general also. For those who get impressed by the dialogs and performance of Govinda in its extra-ordinary climax, it has a repeat value. Otherwise also, it is a decent one time watch."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Drama"",""Romance""]","""1998-11-13""","""hotel,song,humiliation""", ,24.0

Hatya is a scene-by-scene replicate of the other versions, and it is not up to the level of the Telugu film, which really is a rare thriller in how affecting and chilling it is. Hatya adds up several new elements, including some randomly infused moments of high melodrama, some nice but a little redundant songs, and other such ingredients that would meet the standards of a Hindi fare of the times and probably the requirements of a fixed audience as well. This is not to say the original versions lacked all of this, but Hatya takes a good few steps down in this regard as it places emphasis on the emotional side than the actual suspense.\n\nNow don&apos;t get me wrong, I&apos;m fond of Govinda - he is one of the most energetic and charismatic actors I can think of. He&apos;s young and vibrant here, and does well enough even if honestly I preferred Chiranjeevi&apos;s excellent performance. The starlet of yore, Neelam, is as beautiful and gentle as she always was. Like all the other five versions, the film actually recasts two actors from the original - Sujitha, who plays the little precocious deaf-mute boy, who does a good job although clearly the material is too familiar to this child actor, and Babu Antony, who is equally as scary as he was in other versions in the role of the villainous hired killer. Anupam Kher is also here in a pretty common negative role he started doing around that time, and there other familiar faces like Raj Kiran, among others. The music by Bappi Lahiri is quite good, but often redundant.\n\nFor Hindi film buffs, this is a nice go since the familiarity of the cast, the language obviously, and the narrative style is easier to digest. Other than that, personally I was much more impressed with the Telugu version (and I don&apos;t usually watch many regional Indian films, frankly speaking), which I had the pleasure to come across."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Crime"",""Drama""]","""1988-06-03""","""child in jeopardy,murder,escape,deaf mute,jail""","""2H31M""",34.0

Its noteworthy to mention that Lakshmikant-Pyarelal were in top form (a la Himesh Reshamiyya) when Utsav was released and the music of Utsav was completely different to their genre and yes, a bit hit. Lyrics by Vasant Dev are exceptional. Probably after Satyam Shivam Sundaram, one gets to hear such poetry in its purest form.\n\nThe only shortcoming was was language which I felt that there was enough room to improvise as it did not maintain consistency.

In the meantime, Vasu grows up into a successful lawyer, falls in love with Payal (Karisma Kapoor), and dreams of being reunited with Ravi. Unfortunately, Vasu has made an important enemy, and his future happiness, if not his life, is at stake.\n\nThe best part of this melodrama is the light romance between Vasu and Payal. The main plot, which should be moving, is convoluted at times, and the acting not convincing. Even Karisma Kapoor does not display the enthusiasm and energy of her later movies.

Bhagyaraja (both the Hindi and the Tamil versions).\n\nThe film was not successful at the B.O. despite a good story line, great performances, hummable music and some good comedy. Critics attributed the film&apos;s failure to Anil Kapoor and Sridevi&apos;s sagging careers (baring Anil Kapoor&apos;s only successful film Loafer, in the preceding 2 years) before Mr. Bechara hit the screens (only to be revived a year later with the super-hit Judaai).\n\nMr. Bechara narrated the oft told story of a girl who loses her memory and falls for a man, only to regain her memory and recall that her heart belongs to someone else. There have been several films with similar story lines in the past but what distinguished Mr. Behcara from these was it&apos;s comic sequences that did not fall prey to the double meaning syndrome that dominated the film scene around the time this film released (courtesy Anupam Kher, Tiku Talsania and Shakti Kapoor).\n\nAnil Kapoor essayed the title role with ease and Sridevi is a delight to watch. This film proved yet again that she is truly one of the finest actresses India has seen. The penultimate sequence which requires Sridevi to choose between the 2 men in her life is a good example of her prowess. She uses expressions (which has always been her core strength) to convey her emotions instead of dialogs and that&apos;s what makes this scene absolutely brilliant. Anil Kapoor is good in his act as well, showing the audience yet again that he is a terrific performer and can handle any scene with maturity. Anupam Kher does go over the top in a few scenes but provides a few laughs, especially his scenes with Shakti Kapoor. The baby is super-cute. Heera Rajgopal and Nagarjuna get limited scope.\n\nAnand-Milind&apos;s music is infectious and melodious. Khoyee Khoyee Aankhon mein (in 2 versions) is easily the best song in this film. Lage mujhe sunder was another peppy song, that was ahead of its time. And of course Saathi Mere is tuneful, which also proved to be the most popular song when the music released. Although the music did not top the charts in 1996, I still feel it is one of Annad-Milind&apos;s finest works.\n\nOverall, Mr. Bechara is a good family film. Released around the same time as a number of films that indulged in double meaning dialogs and songs, this film refrained from all that and yet managed to provide wholesome entertainment. The film may have failed in 1996, but it has enjoyed satellite runs successfully over the years and is still aired on various channels even in 2012!

His subject is the chawl dwellers in Bombay City. He rents a small tenement there and talks to the people living there. He soon gets involved in their lives, and even gets attra..."",""","""I recently had a re-watch of this hilarious flick. It&apos;s hard to categorize it in a specific genre. It could be viewed as a black comedy or as a dramady of the chawl culture and it can be seen as a parody of Bollywood films. Very enjoyable indeed. Manjrekar himself cleverly wrote the screenplay while Jha directs his first film. You&apos;ll be laughing a lot! As the title claims, the movie focuses on a chawl. It&apos;s sort of in the semi-documentary/semi-feature film format. Sushmita plays herself as the presenter of the documentary. Then there&apos;s another voice-over narrator. The film further focuses on the people living in the chawl. There&apos;s the hyper Ganpat (Vijay Raaj) who pretty much does nothing. There&apos;s a naive housewife Laxmi (Raveena Tandon) who&apos;s desperate to have a baby with her husband (Sanjay Navrekar), there&apos;s Mona, an aspiring actress (Namrata Shirodkar), Dulari (Divya Dutta) a working mother suffering a bad marriage with an alcoholic husband and a greedy mother-in-law, Suman (Rinke Khanna) a young tutor taking care of her traumatized father, Soundarya (Dia Mirza), an &apos;ugly&apos; duckling who&apos;s rejected by every suitor, Sheela (Shweta Menon) a mother of two children and wife of an unemployed abusive husband and numerous other dwellers. While the main focus is on the lives of the women mentioned. We see them living their lives bravely and making the best out of them. In spite of their circumstances, the women are strong, hardworking, caring and they accept the way their life is. Then in contrast, we see most of the men who are lazy, waste their women&apos;s money on booze or anything else, beat their women, fool around etc. Yet, as I mentioned it is a satire and both men and women can easily enjoyed it. Everything is shown in good humour.\n\nContinuing with the plot, the owner of the chawl, Parvin Seth (Khedekar), wants to build a modern shopping complex and is desperate to take back the chawl. He tries to compromise with the inhabitants but in no way are they willing to leave. Seth makes different attempts (he even sends a hit-man) only to fail. Enters a researcher Aman Joshi (Aman Verma) and changes the life of the dwellers. They see new hope in him as he helps them with their difficulties. However, things aren&apos;t the way they seem.\n\nJha directs the film brilliantly and skillfully spoofs it up without falling flat. The language is a little street and coarse (I think kids shouldn&apos;t watch this) definitely adds to the chawl lifestyle, the parody songs e.g. Chale Chalo (from Lagaan), Hum Bhi Hai Josh Mein (Josh) etc. are hilarious and fun to look at. The whole &apos;sati&apos; sequence is another track that provides loads of laughter. I&apos;ll try not to say too much about the content as it&apos;s best if you discover the surprise by yourselves.\n\nAll the performances are very good. To mention a few, Raveena Tandon is fantastic and plays her part with sheer ease in a very natural way (Mahima Chaudhry was the earlier choice for the part). Vijay Raaj, Aman Verma and Divya Dutta are excellent. Sanjay Navrekar is simply hilarious. Namrata Shirodkar does very well. Ditto for Rinke Khanna and Dia Mirza. This is probably Shweta Menon&apos;s best role to date and she does full justice to her part. Sushmita Sen shines with her contagious laughter. Sachin Khedekar is good.\n\nOn a more serious note, the film does help us to appreciate the chawl dwellers. Known as middle class people, they are the hard workers, they&apos;re the ones who keep the country going, who vote, who suffer the most during conflicts e.g. political, they&apos;re the ones who sacrifice, they are strong, they are brave, and to say the least, they are survivors. Thanks to Jha and Manjrekar for making this film and giving us a relevant message through laughter.""},""aggregateRating""","[""Comedy"",""Drama""]","""2003-05-02""","{""total"":0","""2H17M""",19.0

Sundar is uneducated and is duped several times, even by his friends, through his innocence. Sundar meets Payal, portrayed by Rani, and through misunderstanding Sundar is mistaken for being mute. Sundar is uncertain if Payal loves him or pities him, but does not want to lose this love by revealing he can speak. Sundar eventually feels his lies make him unworthy of Payal&apos;s love, so he decides to take a drastic step.\n\nPyaar Diwana Hota Hai is a complete Bollywood film. It provides comedy, romance, musicals, drama, melodrama and to a degree, bittersweet horror. Govinda plays the full gamut of emotions brilliantly and it is hard not to empathize with his character&apos;s increasing anguish. An exemplary moment is while Sundar is waiting in a room before he has an operation. You can feel his pain as he shouts words of love he has never spoken before to Payal! The ending is abrupt and made me cringe as the reality of his actions hit me, but upon reflection, it suited Sundar&apos;s disposition, his guilt for betraying Payal, and his passion to redeem himself to the woman he loves.

It revolves around a &apos;chawl&apos; neighborhood at the center of which live two brothers. The relationships between the characters were portrayed nicely e.g. how Soman&apos;s father confides in Raj and shares his disappointment, how the neighborhood comes to one another&apos;s need etc. Ajay Devgan delivers a decent performance while Namrata Shirodkar shines in her role. She has done a great job of portraying her character&apos;s despair. She&apos;s always there for Raj and Rahul and she yearns for Raj&apos;s love but since he can&apos;t reciprocate her feelings, she gradually walks a path of self-destruction. Sonali Bendre is brilliant, nonetheless. Her character has suffered hardship in the past (this is mildly referred) and now she makes her decisions based on practical thinking. She too loves Raj but she won&apos;t accept Raj&apos;s very limited devotion. Shivaji Sattam does very well and Reema Laggo portrays her character&apos;s metamorphosis wonderfully (but she is a little annoying in the beginning). Anand Raaj Anand&apos;s music is pleasant but some of the songs could have been easily left out as it slows down the pace. The film tries to show that love and care is all what one needs (at least in the case of the two brothers) and hence, why admit the handicapped brother to an institution? The way the institution was presented, with all the patients wearing some kind of uniform, was ridiculous. But why not rehabilitate the handicapped brother and provide him enough love and care? There&apos;s no need to admit him in an institution but he can still receive training and achieve some level of independence. But no, none of that is mentioned. As with a majority of Bollywood movies, this also tends to be melodramatic to some extent. Though I&apos;d still say you could watch it for some fine performances, good music and to feel good.""},""aggregateRating""","[""Drama""]","""2001-11-07""","""four word title,brother brother relationship,old man,unrequited love,mental retardation""","""2H28M""",21.0

The film explores an Impossible India where bizarre is..."",""","""Directed by the renowned theater veteran Feroz Abbas Khan as his second film post GANDHI, MY FATHER (2007), this is indeed a courageous attempt by the makers, since there is not much possibility of such a dark, sarcastic film becoming a big box office success in the current scenario. \n\nReportedly based on some real life events happening in a small town, the film truly reminds you of the recent Muzzafar Nagar incidents leading to a huge loss of life, faith &amp; trust among we all Indians. Made as an intelligent black comedy with many worth praising insertions, DTD surely could have become a daring, path breaking film of the recent times, if only the director had delivered it with a better pace &amp; a more disturbing tension in its conflicting scenes. But keeping the weaker points aside, I would still like to recommend watching it mainly for the following well written and worth-praising scenes, taken straight out of our real lives fast heading towards a scary future. \n\n1. The most valuable sequence in DTD is related to an old experienced historian, who is opposed for writing a controversial book on religious history and is then forced to peacefully withdraw or face some drastic consequences. Ignoring the threat, the calm historian willfully pulls out his hearing machine in between the heated conversation and the act indeed is a treat to watch, executed beautifully. Next all published copies of his book are burned (reminding you of many latest similar references) and that is exactly how history is now being forcefully re- written with a specific motive in almost all the religions proving them better than the rest.\n\n2. A wonderful courtroom scene wherein there is no proof of a dead person&apos;s birth, marriage, original religion or his so called religious conversion at all. But still the judge is supposed to give the judgment about the real owner of the dead body without any valid arguments put forward.\n\n3. A hilarious symbolic sequence in which Satish Kaushik (the owner of a local newspaper) is disgracefully talking to his imported puppy and the employed Indian editor together.\n\n4. In a mourning scene, the few women instantly stop wailing &amp; start leaving as soon as someone says the water is back in the taps for a limited period.\n\n5. As a newly appointed police officer comes to join his police station, he is stunned to see &apos;A Religious Pooja&apos; going on in the station itself and all the policemen attending it instead of going to their assigned duties.\n\n6. A Muslim leader openly addresses a meeting provoking the youth to attack is aggressively opposed by a Muslim journalist only who is thrown out of the meeting. And on the other hand a Hindu leader clearly warns the police officer in charge, not to interfere in their planned procession at all and do nothing.\n\n7. And lastly the undisclosed biased attitude of policemen when they personally know the convict and his particular religion. Following a quite honest and ironical treatment, the film simply reveals the truth that how riots are willfully triggered through an intentional planning by the two opponent leaders openly, whereas they also maintain constant contact with each other simultaneously behind the curtains. \n\nIntelligently written by Shafaat Khan (mostly as a play), the project has been made at a smaller scale with a clever cinematography which shows you the riots just through the window of a moving car without going out in the wide showcasing any big mob. Also the sound department beautifully uses only the natural sounds in the backdrop, creating a very realistic feel throughout in a worth noticing manner.\n\nWith a short duration of less than 2 hours, DTD no doubt remains a comic yet alarming take on a burning issue edited thoughtfully. And with appreciable performances by Satish Kaushik (Leader/Newspaper Owner), Satish Alekar (Historian), Sharad Ponkshe (Hindu Leader) and Vinay Jain (the new IPS officer) along with a fairly impressive supporting cast, it can easily be rated as a praiseworthy attempt for sure, representing the meaningful cinema.\n\nHaving said that, the film still isn&apos;t any great masterpiece or hugely engrossing watch too, mainly due to its few theatrical scenes &amp; the multiple sub-plots resulting in a clumsy feel. Moreover few gags also do not work at all like the one about the police dog or the dead body&apos;s guard taking his clothes off. Plus the film was wrongly promoted with Satish Kaushik as the lead actor (in the posters) who actually has only few scenes in the movie unexpectedly.\n\nSumming up, DEKH TAMASHA DEKH made me think about the last moments of Bhagat Kabir in the past, which also generated a verbal debate among the followers upon the final rituals to be followed. Interestingly in the film too the whole fight is for the body of a converted Muslim only, whom Hindus wish to cremate and Muslims wish to bury, leading to the big bloody clash. And the storyline honestly made me imagine that if there happened to be a death of any similar saint in the present times too then that surely would have resulted in some cruel riots between communities, timely engineered by the opportunist politicians, unarguably.\n\nAnyway with a hope that we all become capable enough of realizing the ugly tricks played by our greedy leaders well in time before hurting the other. Do try to watch this thoughtful attempt as a must ignoring its theatrical feel and all the weaker points mentioned in the review."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy""]","""2014-04-18""","""satire""","""1H50M""",8.0

But not even one of his later ones was able to impress the viewers and HUM TUM SHABANA is also not an exception to that fact. May be the actual reason behind this is that BHEJA FRY was a scene to scene lift from a French Film and all his other films are not a blatant copy of any other Hit from the World Cinema.\n\nBesides, his latest flick HUM TUM SHABANA is regrettably the worst attempt made by the director which is annoyingly loud, silly, irritating and a big pain especially in its second half which can easily be termed as intolerable too. The film starts off with an interesting plot of a beauty pageant where two boys from the organizer&apos;s team are trying to win over one of their lovely contestants. But just after the first 30 minutes, the execution becomes frustrating and you are not able to enjoy anything in the entire later part of the film. Particularly its last hour can give you a severe headache with all that noise and shouting going on in the name of a comedy.\n\nA film can only have good performances if the script allows the artists to perform and the director has got a particular vision to follow. But HTS, in absence of any appreciable script or a basic vision of the director, simply wastes all the talent hidden in the names such as Satish Kaushik, Shreyas Talpade, Tushar Kapoor and Sanjay Mishra. The ladies Minissha and Pia are also there only as the beauty mannequins and are not going to get any kind of response from the movie itself.\n\nActually, as I felt, the biggest culprit of the film is its Sound Mixing in which we have a very loud background score continuously being played along with the dialogues throughout the film in a very unintelligent manner. At times the effects are so deafening that one fails to hear the funny lines said by the actors and feels like walking out of the hall. Yet, there is only one positive thing in HUM TUM SHABANA and that&apos;s the work done by the music director duo Sachin-Jigar who come up with some catchy numbers like &quot;Hey Na Na Na Shabana&quot; and &quot;Music Band Na Karo&quot;, which are sure going to be played in the pub and discos.\n\nOverall, strictly be far away from this if you want to keep your peace of mind intact.""},""aggregateRating""","[""Comedy"",""Crime"",""Drama""]","""2011-09-30""","""gangster""","""2H6M""",11.0

It&apos;s a little difficult to follow in the beginning as the storytelling isn&apos;t linear and it moves back and forth in time. Some of the village sequences (that do not involve Rama and Naurangia) feel a little overstretched. The best parts of the film are the sequences with Shah and Azmi.\n\nOnce the film focuses on the couple&apos;s &apos;quest&apos; to make a life for themselves in the city, the viewers are involved and rooting for them to find a solution. Their struggle mirrors the harsh reality of the streetlife that most villagers experience when they&apos;re looking to make a life in the big busy Asian city (with no connection to anyone). Yet, Naurangia and Rama are not without hope. Their love for one another is solid and they are each other&apos;s strength.\n\nWhen an opportunity, that promises enough money to at least get by for a few days, presents itself to Naurangia he is excited but also cautious. This proves to be a dangerous challenge that involves his four-month pregnant wife but he sees this as the only way out now and they&apos;ll both just have to succeed in this task to survive.\n\nDespite the initial confusion, Ghose&apos;s direction is very good, especially in the second half. I also liked his occasional use of dark humour. The subtle cinematography and score are impressive. Naseeruddin Shah and Shabana Azmi are at their best. That&apos;s not a surprise as these two actors have always brought out the best of each other. Furthermore, Azmi looks beautiful and authentic. Of the supporting cast, Om Puri stands out while the others are competent.\n\n&apos;Paar&apos; succeeds in both its depiction of a reality that is often overlooked and telling a character driven story about survival.""},""aggregateRating""", , , ,"""2H21M""",38.0

These two just play two of the many characters in this film. The movie takes a look in an episodical fashion at several struggling couples who are stuck at an airport due to a long delay of their flight. These couples are either lost loves, broken hearts, on the verge of divorce, or divorcées. The idea is interesting, but it is not executed well. The movie becomes extremely long-drawn and boring. The audience begins to get as impatient as the characters in the movie waiting to board their flight. What I mainly got out of this film is that in today&apos;s busy world, we are all running around, struggling to stay on top of schedule, and end up ignoring, hurting, and miscommunicating with those who mean most to us. All it takes is a few &quot;forced&quot; hours of conversation with no distractions to clear up misunderstandings, lucidly see the other&apos;s point of view, and realize where one&apos;s position in life is. We need to shell out time for our loved ones and communicate with them to avoid broken relationships and/or unnecessary anger/hurt/fear. Mahima and &quot;the crier&quot; gave good performances. Arshad Warsi should stick to comedies and supporting roles as in Munnabhai and Salaam Namaste.

The kidnappers play a dangerous double game to support activists against land grabbing by the Government."",""","""The name was great, the posters were well designed and the subject was well chosen. In fact, the plot was very much in news in the last few weeks only. So the time of its release was also simply perfect. But unfortunately the film fails to materialize on any of these merits and just remains an average kind of first time effort by the writer-actor- director Parvin Dabas. Besides, I was really taken aback by its very poor and sub-standard T.V. promos using the archival footage of our independence without any purpose, which was really not expected from a team having a reasonably good film-experience.\n\nSo as it began, I already had my doubts about its script and execution. Written around a burning issue of Government taking away the farmer&apos;s land in the name of development, the film takes off with reference to four local gang leaders and their don. The first half keeps revolving around these gangsters and their funny kind of gang wars but it doesn&apos;t touch the real issue strongly. The director tries to keep this particular part of the film closer to an off-beat kind of venture talking about the life of farmers living in a village situated in the outskirts of Delhi. The writer mixes the gangster plot well with the land taking over issue, plus the script gets its full support from the original locations and some smartly written dialogues for its key sequences.\n\nBut the film loses both its direction and grip as the gang leader undergoes a heart transformation and decides to take the side of villagers. From here onwards it all becomes too predictable and filmy which fails to generate any kind of interest for the viewers. As a matter of fact, I strongly felt that in order to put too many elements into its narration, Parvin actually ruined the basic thought of the plot and came out with a &apos;mixed vegetable&apos; kind of film not worth applauding.\n\nSDGB tries to bring in the feel of many past HITS forcefully and fails miserably in the process. At times it also looks quite funny &amp; amateur kind of attempt with people shooting, exchanging cars and killing each other without any Police in the scene. The four gangsters remind you of many past RGV films or the youth oriented ones where the boys commit crime along with having fun in the group. It also tries to bring in the Comedy touch as seen in KHOSLA KA GHOSLA earlier which was too based on a similar illegal land acquiring issue. But sadly nothing is up to the mark in the film. Here I also doubt that Parvin Dabas may have thought of making this project while working in KHOSLA KA GHOSLA only and might have roped in Kiran Juneja Sippy and Anupam Kher too having the same in mind.\n\nOn the performance front, I found Parvin deliberately trying hard to give a polished act in the film which was quite visible. And that may be the reason that he was not able to come up that impressive as the silent explosive man. His other three friends along with the rest of the supporting cast are all fine but nothing great with Anupam Kher simply wasted. Musically also it remains just an average fare though the songs are used smartly in its first half. However the Camera-work capturing the local ambiance works great as required by the theme of the film.\n\nOverall, SAHI DHANDHE GALAT BANDE can only be called a well intentioned average first attempt by its actor-writer-director, which remains far away from its exact destination.""},""aggregateRating""","[""Action"",""Comedy"",""Drama""]","""2011-08-19""","""politician,land grab""","""1H59M""",11.0

Having watched it, I&apos;ve to say that despite the patchy feel of the film, there are items of interest here and noteworthy too.\n\nForemost among them is the portion of the film that plays out in Afghanistan (a first for Indian cinema). Hema Malini (as an Afghan clanswoman named Reshma !), Danny Denzongpa and Feroz Khan spice up this sequence that is remarkably well shot by any standards (Buzkashi) and lingers long after the viewing. Premnath in the title role is the other interesting aspect of the film. I&apos;d seen him in Bobby but little else. His portrayal here is just as interesting in its angst and justification for the means he adopts as is the employment of matka (an Indian form of gambling). That it isn&apos;t expanded upon is more to do with the way the script handles the character.\n\nApart from these, the viewing also made me think about the meaning of the word adaptation in the cinematic idiom. When one is besotted with an original, how does one strike a balance between faithful recreation and assuming creative license ? Even more valid is the question - how does one identify the aspects of the original that may not be acceptable to the target audience of the adaptation ? For Feroz Khan in this film shares very little with Michael Corleone and undergoes a transformation so minimal in that his fundamentals are hardly shaken by the turn of events. In an act of complete dilution, he is also spared the moral dilemma of having to plan the demise of his brother-in-law too."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Romance"",""Thriller""]","""1975-04-30""","""beating,loss of loved one,crime boss,father son conflict,directed by star""","""2H43M""",47.0

It is allegedly done by a top notorious don.This forms the crux of the film leading to subsequent comical situations."",""","""Its really great to see a comparatively small film exploring a novel idea trying to give you something fresh moving ahead than the usual. Hence SHARAFAT GAYI TEL LENEsurely earns few brownie points for this much desired brave move taking the risk, but I wish the team had shown the same inventive vision in its writing and execution too saving it from becoming a drag post the initial interesting moments in the first half.\n\nSharing the outline of its exciting plot, just imagine what if the ATM balance receipt one gets out of the money machine surprisingly shows an amount of Rs.100 crores recently credited in the account. And next, the person still struggling to accept the truth receives a &apos;private number&apos; call from none other than the notorious Dawood, who has actually depositing that money in order to have a new middle man in the town delivering his &apos;Havala&apos; payments. Based on this energetic con-plot with a wide scope of many shocking twist and turns, SGTL sadly begins with the same long intros and a song before coming to its core theme. And then instead of becoming a fun-ride, soon loses the grip and goes on overstretching the proceedings missing that expected excitement or energy. \n\nSupporting the film to the best of their ability, everyone in the cast (Anupam Kher, Zayed Khan, Tena Desae &amp; Rannvijay Singh) play their respective roles well but director Gurmmeet Singh fails to exploit the efforts made, delivering a completely lifeless film (with a poor climax) that could have been a fine, fast paced, thrilling entertainer instead. Moreover when you see the names of multiple music directors roped in for the average music to be incorporated in a con-thriller accompanied by an unexciting background score &amp; cinematography, then you realize that probably the film was being conceived in the wrong manner right from the first stage itself missing the required focus.\n\nTo conclude, the fresh interesting plot of a con-game being played between just a few characters (with reference of the over-famous Dawood), gets under-utilized in SHARAFT GAYI TEL LENE released without any publicity campaign. But it still can be seen (just for its enjoyable premise) if you are able to catch it next on a channel or post its release in the home video market in the coming weeks."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Drama"",""Mystery""]","""2015-01-16""","""money""","""1H48M""",7.0

To begin with, its really shocking to know that this is a re-make of director Susi Ganesh&apos;s own successful Tamil film THIRUTTU PAYALE (2006) since the present Hindi version has simply nothing worth praising or even talking about. Moreover, it has such childish sequences in its questionable storyline that it truly makes you wonder that what forced the makers to choose such a film to remake for the Hindi viewers and what was in it that turned its original a hit quite strangely.\n\nInterestingly though a remake, the film&apos;s basic plot does reminds you of a 1982 Reena Roy starrer called BEZUBAAN which also revolved around betrayal and blackmailing. But the execution here is so bizarre and shaky that it totally ruins its otherwise satisfactory plot and gives you nothing in return as a crime thriller. To give you an idea, for a good 10-15 minutes, the film uses some extremely poor graphics (with chroma) showing the four friends touring abroad and then there are few wild life shots too simply reminding you of the Discovery Channel. Moreover, the Kenya locals are used quite hilariously who instead of making you laugh, force you to look at your watch or phone repeatedly.\n\nFurther its quite hard to believe, the way this film has been conceived and directed, with a young boy climbing big mansions (of the rich &amp; famous) so easily surpassing all kinds of security, multi billionaires making their e-mails ids at Gmail and Yahoo known to all, people barging into Police Commissioner&apos;s home just like that and a mother willing to make the most out of her beautiful daughter with some loud and sick intentions. Its over length becomes another nail into the coffin and then the last scene at the race course turns out to be pretty funny instead of exciting, forcing you to leave the theater at once without caring about what happens to the characters in the climax.\n\nSo then does the film has simply nothing to offer literally? No, fortunately there are two appreciable insertions in it as a silver lining in the dark clouds. Firstly it has a thoughtful sequence wherein a 10 years old young boy gets on the wrong path after witnessing his father taking bribe from different persons on a regular basis. And secondly the film has an interesting soundtrack which has few good songs including &quot;Khaali Salaam&quot; &amp; &quot;Jhoom Barabar&quot; well composed &amp; arranged by Himesh Reshamiya.\n\nAs the title suggests, SHORTCUT ROMEO is the rough character played by Neil Nitin Mukesh in the film and I really wonder why Neil is only there in such mediocre projects repeatedly doing all the hard work. Honestly I would love to know what Neil might have been thinking while shooting all those absurd sequences in the film, particularly the scene where he is made to run like a horse in the race course (in the climax). On the other hand both Ameesha Patel &amp; Puja Gupta perform well in their respective roles but the rest keep on over reacting more than required. \n\nIn all, it&apos;s a film which needs to be avoided even when it will be coming on the channels soon, just for free. Or probably you can watch it only to be in the AC for a good two hours along with enjoying a few melodious songs and pretty faces on the screen, in this terrible heat."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Crime"",""Drama""]","""2013-06-21""","{""total"":0","""2H26M""",9.0

The end of the film is a wonderful build-up of emotions and the music is beyond perfect.\n\nBollywood Diaries deserves a 10 stars rating for its honesty in this film tribute to struggling actors trying to make themselves noticed."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama""]","""2016-02-26""","""aspiring actor,bollywood,dreams,tribute,passion""","""2H5M""",6.0

One with vengeance, one on a mission, one with hope and one looking to con."",""","""You can count on Mumbai the city where every man landing here, ends up saying, &quot;Lag Gayi&quot;. Mumbai has it&apos;s own character and makes human lives fall into it&apos;s own daily story. Life Ki Toh Lag Gayi is one such journey of four people tasting a slice of the Mumbai story in a day&apos;s time.\n\nSalmaan (Kay Kay Menon) is a revenge seeking builder searching for his parents murderers. He divulges into past and present making his search interesting and indulging. His discovering of gun is a scene to watch out for. Amol Ganguly (Ranvir Shorey) easily slips into a Bengali babu caught in a honey trap, courtesy Deboshree making his life miserable. Enters Ajoy Ghosh (Pradhuman Singh) and adds a new dimension to all heart broken romantic idiots and makes Amol&apos;s life terrible. Amol and Ajoy turn your white blood cells into black with their effort-full suicidal tactics. Dolly Saluja (Neha Bhasin) is a financially broken runaway girl, lured by stardom. Her escapades make her look into the real life in Mumbai making for interesting viewing.\n\nKay Kay Menon is in form and displays controlled aggression. You want more of him, but the screen time doesn&apos;t permit so. Ranvir Shorey does well for his Amol, the sequel will make him a dangerous character to vouch for. Pradhuman Singh&apos;s Ajoi is a maniac musical dilemma, straight out of Guns and Roses. He is a revelation and relaxation for the young generation with preaching hell ways. Manu Rishi is the surprise package of the lot. With a heavy Delhi lingo and care free attitude, he sleep walks into his character Chautala with tension tension and more tension. Mass is always class with Chautala. Whereas, Neha Bhasin does justice to her Punjabi character with ease.\n\nRakesh Mehta, the writer director clearly has heavy influences and inclinations towards underworld subjects. Managing three more layered stories with the same background is quiet a feat. He has tried to maintain a fine balance and has surely come close to the right mix. His dialogues supports the director in him perfectly. Mumbai through his lens is nostalgic.\n\nCatch the film for Salmaan&apos;s subtleness, Chautala&apos;s aggression, Ajoy- Amol&apos;s unbalanced chemistry and Dolly&apos;s edgy life. Discover Mumbai again before you say &apos;Lag Gayi&apos;."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Comedy""]","""2012-04-20""","""city""","""2H35M""",10.0

When the Thakur&apos;s colleague Raja Singh cheats him and runs away with his loot, Jogi is arrested and sentenced for life i..."",""","""Joshilaay is a movie with a Western feel, complete with trigger-happy bandits, smokin&apos; pistols and gunfire and a plot that borrows heavily from John Wayne-Clint Eastwood movies. But before you sit to watch it, be prepared for some annoyingly loud background music that&apos;ll pierce your ears during the climactic scenes. However, considering that the film was released way back in 1989, most of its melodramatic excesses are somewhat forgivable. After all you just can&apos;t ignore a movie like Joshilaay (and many others such as Khote Sikkey, Kala Sona, Chunaoti, Jagir etc). These movies gave Indian audience the typical &apos;desi&apos; mix of Bollywood and Western flicks. Joshilaay on its part is particularly memorable for its cinematography, scenes shot in the arid landscapes of Ladakh, the composed acting of Anil Kapoor (usually known for his loud acting) and of course the dreaded bandit JOGI THAKUR. The actor who played the role deserves to be placed in the same ranks as the late Amjad Khan or Amrish Puri. It&apos;s rather sad that we remember Gabbar Singh, Mogambo and Mola Ram, but if someone asks &apos;Remember Jogi Thakur?&apos; the curt response would be &quot;Jogi who?&quot; Overall, Joshilaay is an underrated film that deserves recognition from today&apos;s viewers. But let me also warn you... the movie prints are in bad condition. Sometimes the screen turns dark during daytime scenes and you might think there&apos;s a solar eclipse going on every now and then. No proper restoration was done for the prints and it&apos;s evident that the director himself lost interest in restoring the film maybe because it was a massive flop upon release. Whatever, the solar eclipse phenomenon is in some way countered by Sridevi&apos;s flashing jewelry. As you watch Sridevi you seriously wonder how a poor Banjaran girl whose father runs a small traveling theater troupe can afford such expensive jewelry. As for the songs in the film, the only memorable one is the title song sung with amazing manliness by the late Kishore Kumar. The other three songs in the film are too loud, absurd and unnecessary."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Drama"",""Western""]","""1989-01-10""","""shotgun,betrayal,fire,showdown,shot in the chest""","""1H47M""",33.0

So from that angle KUKU MATHUR KI JHAND HO GAYI can easily be rated as a fairly decent debut attempt by the director Aman Sachdeva to recreate the look, feel &amp; magic of films such as KHOSLA KA GHOSLA, DELHI BELLI, VICKY DONOR and FUKREY (all revolving around a similar backdrop).\n\nSo following the same Hit pattern, Aman Sachdeva also makes his light hearted movie moving around Delhi only with mostly Punjabi &amp; Haryanvi characters interacting with each other. Talking about two fast friends, stepping into their real life after passing the 12th exams, it showcases how one of them (Kuku) takes a wrong decision on a third person&apos;s advice and then later repents on the same, returning to his dear friend. Made on a familiar &apos;seen before&apos; kind of base (with a unusual catchy title), the film does have its few moments and some good performances too coming from the fresh cast. But the problem actually lies in its too thin plot which remains unconvincing throughout as such drastic, senseless and criminal step is not insanely taken by a friend against the other for just a small revenge. Moreover a lot of time gets wasted in the beginning (almost 35-40 minutes), wherein the film has nothing to convey as per its storyline and it keeps showcasing their friendship only through various sequences. Further the criminal activities are performed with such an ease or confidence, without any moral fear or hesitation that it all seems to be too filmy to believe in.\n\nWith a mediocre soundtrack, non-contributing background music and an average cinematography, KMKJHG actually just falls short of being as realistic as any of the Delhi based films mentioned above. Selecting an unusual title inspired from the local lingo, the accent sounds to be artificial most of the times and the next to door family kind of feeling is largely missing. Also the film keeps following its inspirational sources devotedly, which is clearly visible in sequences such as the Jagaran one, straight away reminding you of FUKREY.\n\nIn the performance section, both Siddharth Gupta (Kuku) &amp; Ashish Juneja (Rony) show their confident sparks in few good scenes and Simran Kaur Mundi is just OK with nothing much to do along. Pallavi Batra (as the actress) impresses, but also tries to be a loud clone of Parineeti Chopra. Siddharth Malhotra (Rony&apos;s elder brother),Brijendra Kala (as Baba Ji), Somesh Agarwal (Kuku&apos;s father), Anoop Puri (Rony&apos;s Grandfather) and Rajesh Sharma (Jagran Singer) add their own individual bit to this simple, social comedy. But its the enjoyable acts of Amit Sial (as Mama Ji), Alok Chaturvedi (as the Watchman), and the actress playing the watchman&apos;s villager wife, which actually make the film interesting enough despite having a quite non-existing plot line.\n\nIn short, KUKU MATHUR KI JHAND HO GAYI is a light hearted comic film trying to impress that particular section of viewers who loved watching similar, recent entertainers like FUKREY. But scoring a lot less in comparison, it also strictly remains the one which you might enjoy more watching on a TV channel without making an effort or spending a good amount of money on its costly multiplex tickets."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Romance""]","""2014-05-30""","""friend""","""1H49M""",8.0

Rooks takes Singh&apos;s social realist narrative and faithfully transcribes it to the screen, with the allegory of India&apos;s tragic fate still bitterly intact. Hopefully, this film will gather a wider audience later in its life than it had upon release when it was all but ignored, in India and abroad. It has an important message to us all about the reality of cross-cultural harmony being destroyed by desperate and ignorant ideologues.

Despite not having seen the first Hyderabad Blues, I have to say that the film gave me a new vision of the social lives of contemporary middle-class Indians. The plot was quite tedious - focusing on one guy&apos;s indiscretions with a work colleague and his fiancée&apos;s subsequent soul searching over whether to take him back - and the characters were mostly a bunch of macho, unsympathetic yuppies, but the acting was on the whole quite natural, and the film didn&apos;t glamourise the petty events of these people&apos;s lives. It surprised me to see an Indian movie, made for Indian audiences, presented in a realistic way. Maybe this isn&apos;t such an odd thing for an Indian viewer, but for someone whose main exposure has been to subtitled Bollywood musicals or sanitised Westernised productions (think &apos;Monsoon Wedding&apos;), it was quite novel to hear such casual swearing and vulgar talk from both men and women."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama"",""Comedy""]","""2004-07-02""","""challenge,cleavage,seduction""", ,18.0

Chandigarh is shot with a gorgeous and attentive naturalism that really evokes the rhythms of an Indian city and its characters. The supporting cast offer a nice range of ideas and performances, providing some kind of dressing to the naive insufferable idiot that we are supposed to somehow relate to. The main character is a man, or just boy, that wanders aimlessly from place to place, saying nothing of worth about anything, living a life with no seeming skills or talents, languishing in tired cliches that have no meaning. Don&apos;t get me wrong, this is a perfect example of many unbearable boobs i have encountered in India, indeed maybe my anger stems from how i see echoes of myself in him, especially before life throws some spanners in the works. This is also not a slight at the actor. If the intention was to make the most vacuous and kinda robotic symbol of personality devoid westerner, spoon-fed on tv into a passive nothing, then its perfect. I mean for heavens sake, he can&apos;t even describe the book moby dick, or say what he likes to write about. The most tell bit of the film is when he&apos;s ask by his dad just to do something for his home video, and reliably enough, he just stands there with this kinda baby like seriousness, a mind lost in a bland confusion of dissatisfaction.

Played at the 2015 Vancouver International Film Festival, the movie follows the lives of a Sikh family who were caught up in the ever deteriorating situation in their neighbourhood in Delhi. \n\nThe first thing that you will notice is the flimsiness of the plot and quite frankly the acting as well. The acting is done in a way that the actors are trying to &quot;act the hell out of it&quot;. So all you notice is the actors very cheery while they speak (as if they&apos;re on camera for the first time) for the first half of the film, and then so forcefully emotional to a point where it is cringe worthy to watch. It&apos;s not to say there isn&apos;t a well-known actor in the movie, as Soha Ali Khan (Dil Maange More) plays the mother but that absolutely does not redeem the film. \n\nThere is an unbelievable amount of indulgence (close to Tarantino - esque) with the camera continually panning over the dead bodies in the houses and streets and lingering on them for far longer than they should have. \n\nNow, the only thing that can be said about the plot is the crazed propaganda behind the movie, which if you don&apos;t notice it during the movie; you&apos;ll surely know by the time the helpful footnotes at the end of the movie play. \n\nThere is a movie to be made about the 1984 genocide as it&apos;s a very important subject for the people of Indian and those abroad, and honestly for the rest of the world.

The film&apos;s plot deals with the unexpected disappearance of this cache of money, 500 koka&apos;s to be precise, on a Raigad Highway which is ambushed by an armed and highly skilled foursome. The anxious don in an act of madness goes on a rampage suspecting his competitive mafia top bosses and begins a gang war in the city. He wants his money back and will go to grave lengths to take it even if this means bringing the city to a standstill reflecting very poorly on the government in power. Director Ashu Trikha showcases how bloodshed can be a result of cunning moves from higher ups or officials almost like leading lambs to slaughter. The men instructed to handle the case are headed by Sunil Shetty (Eklavya Karmarkar, fondly known as Bhau), who we see return to a role he is most comfortable in and that&apos;s full blown action. He plays the cool, suave and calm plain clothes leader of the special Unit 9. It&apos;s been a while since we&apos;ve seen Anna in action which almost makes me forgot what made him a star back in the 90&apos;s. He comfortably jumps straight into the action with a raid on the Don&apos;s hideout, based on information from our 2nd Unit member and planted mole in Mukhtar&apos;s gang, Mahaakshay Chakraborty. The other 2 support roles are played by Kay Kay Menon (Naeem Shaikh) and Johnny Lever (Eric Collaco). Amongst a group of actors so diverse and talented I thought it would be an uphill battle for a youngster to shine. Given a meaty role, Mahaakshay has stood the test, with full marks on the emotion and definitely above average in the action. \n\nWhat i admired most about the portrayal of Unit 9 was the realistic and raw feel of emotion and camaraderie amongst the officers. &apos;Brothers of the sword&apos; of sorts, whether it was the maturity of a boy to a man in the size of his pegs or an accusation being filed each man backs the other up. Unit 9 functions like the 3 musketeers except there are 4 of them. They are best of friends personally and professionally. Unity is strength here as well as all for one and one for all is the spirit amongst them. Eklavya&apos;s friendship with Naeem goes back to their childhood days a bond which is strong and powerful. Mukhtar the Don is now behind bars but the gang war continues, with a reputation and possible votes at stake the Centre decides to send in a specialist. Throwing gasoline over an already raging fire and in enters Mithun Chakraborty as Yugantar Sharma to temper the situation in Mumbai city. Here&apos;s where the twist in the tale takes places as he soon realizes who those 4 masked bandits are and the cat and mouse chase begins. Unit 9 here are the perpetrators and the investigators. It&apos;s always a treat to watch Dada on screen, the most underrated cinema legend in his own right I thoroughly enjoyed how he cracks the whip singly on each member of Unit 9. \n\nThe story boils down to an intense police drama with a mixed bag of emotions from belonging to distrust to the literal taking a bullet for a brother. A sensational shootout results in the killing of Naeem Sheikh (KK Menon) as well as members of the don&apos;s gang in the cross fire. A vast array of emotions are showcased here from internal confusion, shock and extreme anger. Members of Unit 9 reach the spot to see their fallen comrade. Grief plus arguing with CBI man Yuganthar Sharma begins and from a blame game this develops in to a quest as the men now are determined to get justice for the killing of their fallen comrade. The matter at hand and prime focus is to bring to justice the dreaded Don. The story may seem cliché at points from the use of clandestine detective tricks, unnecessary over running of lines, a horrible item number to an I&apos;ve Seen This Before ending but all in all it&apos;s a more emotional take on a cop drama that i can remember in recent times. I&apos;ve definitely seen better work from Zakir Hussein in the past and feel he&apos;s better with a menacing touch than a tapori don! Johnny Lever has been underutilized and should have been allowed to provide some comic relief. At times he looked caged. \n\nAll in all it&apos;s a cop drama that keeps you intrigued and entertained till the very end. Enemmy throws light on a Mob-Police-Political tainted System and a dangerous nexus plus how the 3 of them co-exist and flourish side by side each feeding off the other. From the Top to the Bottom how corrosion of conformity exists and how anybody could do anything for a price as well as ambition. The enemy is truly within us and society&apos;s weakness is reflected and a can of worms is opened up. How has corruption, taking the easy way out and the greed for money eaten its way from law enforcement to leadership is what the film asks You? The film also shows several actors and characters in their own space and is intriguing with its numerous twists and turns. Enemmy throws light on various serious issues. Why would those who upkeep the law resort to stealing or robbery? The film showcases the grave steps officers take to make ends meet and protect their loved ones. Truly a multi starrer with suspense, action and exposing a sordid system which confronts all of us. A sign of the times! Is Material greed and wealth the only solution to your problems? If you&apos;re rushing into theaters to be entertained like I do then this is definitely worth a watch.""},""aggregateRating""","[""Action"",""Crime"",""Drama""]","""2013-06-21""","""gang""", ,9.0

The second role when Govinda played a Qawali singer, made me smile...and Raveena Tandon seemed to bring a bit of life to this movie. \n\n~ The songs were okay, out of the whole movie, the best song has to be Waah Tera Kya Kehna, when we are first introduced to Raveena and the 2nd Govinda. the rest are fairly moderate and the worst has to be I want money! with a film like that Govinda you aren&apos;t going to get much! \n\n~ The only person who seemed to enjoy it out of my family and i, was my younger brother who was five at the time. and you can see why, its childish humour. its audience should have been targeted towards five years old, not adults. \n\n~ So in short, If you want a Bollywood movie for your under tens then this is good...otherwise anyone over ten should bring a book with them to read whilst watching it, believe me it gets very boring!"",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Comedy"",""Crime""]","""2002-11-01""","""love,police officer,father son relationship,greed,dual role""","""1H40M""",20.0

He had a knack to represent things and character in some different fashion. They are differently narrative and finish with an uneasiness in the mind of the audience. Audience would not feel fully satisfied with the ending but would believe that it was what the film was destined for. I heard he has influence of European films, specially french in his works and it just proved so true to me. The camera work, sound, representing characters are very unlike of Indian movies of that time and I can now understand why he is compared to Satyajit Ray. To me this film seems very well acted and plotted. I don&apos;t know, probably I could relate with the movie more and that&apos;s the reason I am more interested in it? &quot;Khandhar&quot;, the ruined house is the movie I am talking about. One of the best performances of Shabana Azmi with a gloomy melancholy narration of past is what wondered me. The unspoken words, the helplessness, the unresponsiveness towards what is happening in that time set the film apart. Audience will feel a bit of dissatisfaction, a gloom over the plot. The main theme is of a ruined house where three friends come to see one of the friend&apos;s ancestral house which is in a verge to be ruined. They came there to have good times and there could the story be ended but Shabana Azmi turned this table around and took the charge from here. It was indeed not a solo performance by her but she put the best on it. She is my one of the favorite actresses but she just broke her record and set it to a distance difficult to cross. She had been thoroughly submerged in the character and you can not apart her from the character. As a director Mrinal Sen had some experiment with the background and camera. He extensively chose some background focus and some sudden wonders. I am feeling lucky that I came across this film on my own--just by delving inside.

Fortunately everyone liked. I was the first person to clap in the theatre in the end and then every one clapped. It was satisfying to see this film and i must thank Nishtha Jain, the maker for taking all the pain and roam around in Banda district villages and shoot this stuff, especially it must be quiet painful to shoot the charred body of that girl.

In one hand Ramprasad Tiwary kind of demons, who will instil so much of fear in people that people did not vote against him and on the other hand people like Husna who are so deeply treaded under the norms that she will leave the Gulabi Gang but not go against wrongs. I can not blame Husna for it. Its the men who have made this kind of society and its pompous norms. Girls fall in love, kill her, boy rapes someone, save her.

The film was released somewhere around 1989 and casts most of the actors that were simply tagged as horror veterans during the mid and late 80s. The film is long as most of the other Bollywood horror films of that time and features a mishmash of 3-4 tales, entwined with one other but they somehow work and doesn&apos;t leave the movie as boring as Ramsays&apos; other horror films like &apos;Tahkhana,&apos; &apos;Mahakaal,&apos; and &apos;Ajooba Kudrat Ka&apos;.\n\nThe film begins with a couple Raja (Anil Dhawan) and Rita (Priti Sapru) who unintentionally land up at a grand Haveli not really knowing its dire past. The couple succumbs to the peaceful atmosphere of the Haveli and believe that they have found a good place to spend night in the woods. As the Haveli is jinxed, the pair soon discovers that the Haveli is the lair of a wicked ghoul, who would kill anyone that comes there. Raja is soon killed by the ghost (Manek Irani, aka the notorious Billa), and Rita also meets the same consequence. We see an old man, who lives by the Haveli, somehow tackle the monster with a holy cross, then cage and lock him down in the basement.\n\nWe then see a small time photographer Sunil (Deepak Parashar), who is overwhelmingly in love with a rich lass Anita (Amita Nangiya). Ever since her parents died, Amita was looked after and brought up by her uncle Kumar (Vijay Arora). However Kumar and his wife Seema (Neelam Mehra) have spun a web of deceit and lies around Anita and are only looking for the good time to get control of Anita&apos;s financial assets. Anita trusts her uncle and aunt and never questions their intention. Seema wants Anita to get married with her brother Vikram (Tej Sapru), so that it would be easy for her to claim Anita&apos;s property. Kumar soon plans to buy a grand Haveli (yes the same Haveli) from Rana Sahab (Pinchoo Kapoor), who wants to sell it out. Kumar goes to the Haveli, but soon discovers that the Haveli is haunted. His belief is further strengthened when he finds Rana&apos;s corpse. Kumar tries to escape, but his efforts go in vain and he dies a gruesome death.\n\nA few days later, Anita and her friends go to the Haveli to spend their break. Sunil follows Anita too but things turn badly when a stalking Vikram and his henchmen also land up at the Haveli. Vikram soon gets an opportunity and strikes Sunil making him unconscious. Sunil is dragged to the basement and is locked inside. When Sunil regains his senses, he hears some groaning noise. He comes to know that the sound is emerging from a caged room under the basement. He is about the unlock the cage when the same old man stops him from doing so. The old man reveals his name as Navin (Narendra Nath) and claims the monster to be his own son, who was hideously deformed when by mistake he and his wife had to stop at the Haveli as his wife was in labor pain and the hospital was far away. The Haveli was home to an evil spirit that possessed the sprog and since then, the old man guards people against this monster. Sunil somehow believes the old man and leaves the monster locked in the cage. The monster is mistakenly released by one of the perpetrators and the Haveli reanimates with foul incidents. Now its up to the lead cast to save themselves from monster, who won&apos;t let anyone escape from his domain.\n\nThe movie lacks constant atmosphere and most of the actors (minus the lead cast) look like rehab retards who pushily play their parts. Ramsays have once again applied the hairy monster formula, the efficacy of which fizzles out in between. The long comedy sequences and torturous parts by Satish Shah and Tina Ghai definitely prevent this to gain the &apos;higly recommended&apos; status. Watch this only if you are a big fan of Deepak Parashar and Amita Nangia. Since this one is not as close to me as Ramsays&apos; other gems like &apos;Do Gaz Zameen Ke Neeche&apos;, &apos;Sannata&apos;, &apos;Hotel&apos;, &apos;Dahshat&apos; and &apos;Darwaza&apos;, I would give this 5/10."",""reviewRating""","[""Horror""]","""1989-02-07""","""ramsay&apos;s horror""","""2H19M""",33.0

The only companion he has is a ghost, a ghost that will not let go of him."",""","""It&apos;s true that Horror as a genre has indeed got its own audience and success ratio in Bollywood. But that does not give us the liberty or license to keep on giving mediocre and repetitive kind of movies in the name of HORROR. In fact, films such as A FLAT may become responsible for killing the excitement and fun involved in this particular genre which can still bring in good number of people in the theater. Hence as stated above, this week we have a completely wash-out venture offered to the lovers of Horror films which quite funnily not even once scares you in its less than 2 hours of duration. In other words, almost everything in A FLAT is simply monotonous and uninteresting which never rises above than what you have already seen in all those famous successful scary films released in the past.\n\nBased on the most over-used formula of a haunted flat having a mysterious story to tell, A FLAT actually reveals its entire secret in its title itself. And that only takes away all the fun of watching it since you already know where the secret lies in the script. Moreover the uninspiring angle of bringing an innocent village girl to the town and then unwillingly killing her further reduces your interest in the film as the plot has earlier been used uncountable times in Hindi movies in the past.\n\nWith performers not looking like the character they are playing, A FLAT also becomes a victim of a not so convincing casting. For instance, Sachin Khedekar&apos;s sequence of losing his character at that age is not well conceived or written, both Hazel and Naseer Abdullah never look or speak like village residents, Sanjay Suri doesn&apos;t give you the feeling of a wicked character, there is no chemistry between the love pair of Jimmy-Kaveri and Jimmy Shergill really looks like doing it as a burden assignment in most of his scenes.\n\nIn addition to this, A FLAT heavily relies on the same old shaky camera tricks played along with some loud sound effects to scare you out which don&apos;t work at all. In absence of any good music or exceptional cinematography it never really gives you any moment to enjoy or feel engrossed.\n\nSo after watching it you only have one question in mind that if this was the debut attempt of the director Hemant Madhukar, then why did he chose such kind of jaded subject and treatment which simply had no potential of giving him even an average earner. With a plot reminding you of the FLAT in BHOOT (2003), the hairy spirit of THE RING (2002) and the basic storyline of KUDRAT (1981), he really should have thought of something else to prove himself."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama"",""Horror"",""Romance""]","""2010-11-12""","""ghost,apartment,death,betrayal,adultery""","""1H43M""",12.0

Naseerudin shah is another cop against Sonu but he is hardly there with 3-4 dialogs so we may say its a special appearance. Vinay Pathak is good in his politician avatar. Shocked to see talent like Arya Babbar (Ready, Yaar Anmulle) in such role that too for 10 mins, like whats the point to cast such an excellent actor in this sort of role. Neha dhupia is good as an housewife. Anjana Sukhani, Rajendra Gupta, Mukesh Bhatt and Murli Sharma were all waisted. The person who really shines here is Amit Sadh (Kohinoor, Guns a&amp; Roses). He portrays his character of journalist in a simple manner the only character who don&apos;t have grade shades in the movie. He is husband of Punjabi actress Neeru Bajwa (Jihne Medra Dil Luteya, Jatt N Juliet).Climax is very much similar to Sehar but Sehar was a top class movie. Kabeer Kaushik did his best in Direction part but still this movie lacks something.

Sanjeev Kumar gives an amazing performance in the movie.His comic timing,expression and famous dialog delivery are excellent.He is comfortable in the scenes where he is shown as the timid man opposite a rather independent and commanding Zeenat Aman.But my favourite scene is when he has an outburst and blasts Zeenat thus showing that it is only natural for men to behave this way even if he was enjoying taking orders from the lady.I guess Manoranjan is Zeenat Aman finest performance.She actually showed that being bold just did not mean body exposure but acting in movies which are bold in their content also.Her performance is the highlight if the movie.Unfortunately except for B.R.Chopra who took out an excellent performance from her in &apos;Insaaf Ka Taraazu&apos;,no-one could extract a performance the way Shammi did in this movie(not even the over-hyped Raj kapoor in Satyam Shivam Sundaram).Shammi kapoor had put on a lot of weight and although he hammed for most of the portion he still shows his class in some scenes.Dev Kumar as the strong villain suited the role to T(Shammi again signed him as a giant in his other directorial dud Bundalbaaz).Paintal,Madan puri and Agha are adequate.\n\nWhen released in 1974 Manoranjan did not do well at the box- office,probably because it was very bold.However over the years it has formed the position of a classic.On the whole Manoranjan is an excellent movie which though very bold and could still raise eyebrows if seen at home."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Musical"",""Romance""]","""1974-01-11""","""nawab,prostitute,red light district,policeman,faked death""","""2H38M""",48.0

This does not anger well with their fellow collegian, Kundan who has them..."",""","""Ranbir Kapoor and Hrithik Roshan are today&apos;s superstars. However their fathers (Rishi Kapoor and Rakesh Roshan) have not only been good friends in real life but also given some entertaining movies by their joint performances in reel life more than three decades back. Though Rishi Kapoor was a superstar of the seventies and the eighties whereas Rakesh Roshan was considered a B grade hero only, their on-screen chemistry was amazing. Perhaps their real life friendship helped them in creating magic on the screen. Today I am reviewing a movie which is a mindless romantic comedy starring these two heroes which can be enjoyed by keeping your mind under lock and key only. It&apos;s Aapke Deewaane (1980) whose presenter is none other than Rakesh Roshan himself.\n\nAapke Deewaane (crazy for you) is the story of two friends - Ram (Rishi Kapoor) and Raheem (Rakesh Roshan) who are apparently orphans and live together while studying in a college. They are the filmi ideals of communal harmony because Ram scores 92% marks in Urdu whereas Raheem scores similarly in Hindi. They bring about the first twist in their friendship tale by adopting O Henry&apos;s classic story - The Gift of the Magi by selling own favourite items to buy gifts for each other. Well, we are moved by their filmi friendship.\n\nNow the next twist in the tale comes through the villain who is the college bully - Kundan (Ranjeet) who frames them in a false molestation charge and gets them rusticated from the college. However they injure him in the ensuing fist-fight and run away from the city. Now their (filmi) destiny carries them to a Kashmir where they face the problem of making a living. Their problem gets resolved through the job of tutoring a young girl - Sameera (Tina Munim) who is the foster-daughter of two aged bachelors - Thakur Vikramjit Singh (Pran) and Inshallah Khan (Ashok Kumar). Since both these guardians are against keeping young men as her tutors, our heroes have to masquerade themselves. Ram opts for the disguise of an old man whereas Raheem disguises himself as a middle-aged woman. Ram in his real self pretends to be the son of the lady-teacher (i.e., Raheem in disguise) and Raheem on the other hand pretends to be the son of the old male tutor (i.e., Ram in disguise). Sameera finds both Ram and Raheem as worthy of becoming her husband but her dilemma is whom to choose out of these two. Her guardians, quite naturally, choose both these heroes as her beaus according to their own personal choices.\n\nThe mindless comedy alongwith this love triangle moves on till the villain is back to inflict his revenge upon the heroes. His attack on the heroine resolves the love triangle too. Finally in the wedding party, Ram and Raheem shake hands and the screen reads - FRIENDSHIP NEVER ENDS (instead of THE END). I believe in this dictum. Hope, my readers also do.\n\nThis nonsense movie works mainly because of the amazing on-screen chemistry between the two heroes. Rishi and Rakesh compliment each other perfectly and the screen is lit up by their admirable performances. Their another real-life friend Jeetendra is also there in a guest role with an item number being picturized on him (with the two heroes joining him in the dance). Tina Munim seems to know only smiling in the name of acting. Ashok Kumar and Pran try to repeat their Victoria No. 203 act with partial success only. Ranjeet as villain is routine. Young and beautiful Shoma Anand too is there in a cameo.\n\nMusic composed by Rakesh Roshan&apos;s brother (and Hrithik Roshan&apos;s uncle) - Rajesh Roshan is according to the mood of the movie. The title track alongwith the Rafi-Kishore duet - Tumko Khush Dekhar Main Bahut Khush Hua stands out. One more song - Ram Kare Allah Kare (containing western effect through -APININANA BENTO) which has sung by Rafi and Amit Kumar (Kishore Kumar&apos;s son) is also impressive and entertaining.\n\nCinematography spreading the beauty of Kashmir on the screen is extremely eye-soothing. Technically the movie is up to the mark. However editing should have been better. The movie irritates at places but if you watch it without trying to locate logic in it, you will enjoy it thoroughly.\n\nI recommend this movie to the fans of Rishi Kapoor and Rakesh Roshan who will find this mindless comedy certainly better than the contemporary David Dhawan and Anees Bazmee comedies.

Vanshikha falls in love with Abhay, but he finds her unattractive. She changes her appearance, capturing his attention, but he doesn&apos;t want a serious relationship.

I don&apos;t think these things even came close to outweighing the good qualities this movie contained. What really got me was the passion in which the actors brought out the characters. It&apos;s such an innocent movie. If I was to watch the first five minutes and the last five minutes, I wouldn&apos;t have known the two scenes were connected. I liked the fact that I never knew where the movie would go (in a good way, not that it was hard to follow). Isn&apos;t that an element of a good, thought out, creative movie? I believe so.

Devastated, he takes to alcohol."",""","""Amanush (1975) is a very popular, commercially successful and critically acclaimed movie made in both Hindi and Bengali. Directed by Shakti Saamanta, this movie is based on Shaktipada Raajguru&apos;s story - &apos;Naya Basat&apos;. The pillar of Indian cinema in general and Bengali cinema in particular - Uttam Kumar played the lead role in it with the ever gorgeous Sharmila Tagore, another gift to Indian cinema from Bengal, being cast opposite him.\n\nWe all criticize, discard, scorn and sometimes hate the drunkards. But why does an otherwise normal person turn into a drunkard ? Seldom we ponder over this question. Drinking is bad but as they say, &apos;I drink to forget my sorrow&apos; (Gham Bhulaane Ke Liye Peeta Hoon), sometimes a drunkard requires genuine sympathy and understanding (if not love) to return to his normal self. Change the circumstances, changes the person. Amanush (non-human being or beast) underscores this fact.\n\nThe Amanush of this movie who generates both fear and hatred at the same time in the onlookers, is an alcoholic Madhusudan Chaudhary (Uttam Kumar) whose alcoholism and weird activities are visible to all but not the mountain of grief hidden in his heard. He was in love with Lekha (Sharmila Tagore) but an intricate conspiracy masterminded by Mahim Ghoshal (Utpal Dutt) against him destroyed everything for him, making his life no better than hell for him. The severest pinch for him is the lack of understanding on the part of his sweetheart Lekha. If only she understood him correctly ! But . . .! Alas ! But as they say, times change. Day follows night and primavera follows autumn. Living in complete dark, Madhusudan&apos;s life gets a ray of sunshine when a sensitive cop Bhuvan Roy (Anil Chatterjee) comes across him. He tries to trace the origins of the alcoholism and the weird behaviour of Madhusudan and then finally reaches the truth which had turned a Maanush (human-being) into an Amaanush (beast). Things change for Madhusudan, Lekha comes to understand him correctly and the baddie is finally served right.\n\nAll of a sudden, I have got a flash of lightning in my heard that the super hit movie of Sunil Shetty and Ajay Devgan - Dilwaale (1994) was also based on the same theme only with Ajay Devgan in the role akin to that Uttam Kumar in Amanush. However contrary to formula-studded Dilwale, Amanush is a far better movie and much more sensitive movie especially the Bengali version.\n\nDirector Shakti Saamanta has handled the admirable story well but still his direction leaves something to be desired in the Hindi version. The grief and stuffiness in the heart of the protagonist is revealed to the audience more through the stellar performance of the actor (Uttam Kumar) and less through the script and the direction.\n\nThe movie is quite entertaining and gripping and that&apos;s one good reason for its huge commercial success. The story flows well mostly in the flashback and thoroughly entertains the audience. There&apos;s no boredom at any place though there are no relief moments also in the serious storyline.\n\nOn one hand, I like Bhuvan Roy&apos;s sympathetic and understanding attitude the aggrieved and misunderstood hero, on the other I dislike Lekha&apos;s easily misunderstanding him and turning her back to him. If you love someone, you have to learn to trust him / her also. Even when the whole world seems to be against him / her, he / she should feel that at least you are on his / her side, you are understanding him / her, your shoulder is there for resting the head and shed tears. Else your love is nothing but hollow, a fair weather friend. It&apos;s difficult to correctly understand someone, misunderstanding is always easy but unfortunately, most of us prefer to choose this easy path.\n\nThe movie is soaked in Bengali culture and environment and all the technical aspects appear to be in more or less in order. Mostly shot in the Sunderbans, the movie renders a different flavour, pleasantly different I must say. The milieu is in sync with the story and the characters.\n\nThe biggest asset of this movie is Uttam Kumar whose towering performance makes it watchable for all. Sharmila Tagore fits the bill of the heroine very well. Another brilliant performance in the movie is of Utpal Dutt in the role of the villain. Anil Chatterjee has also done satisfactorily as the sympathetic cop. The supporting cast is well in place.\n\nShyamal Mitra&apos;s music is very good. Kishore Kumar&apos;s popular sad song - Dil Aisa Kisi Ne Mera Toda (which is the title track) is the highlight of this movie. Kal Ke Apne Na Jaane Kyun and Gham Ki Dawa To Pyar Hai (both by Asha Bhosle) and Na Poochho Koi Hamen Zahar Kyun Pee Liya (by Kishore) are also quite good. The meaningful lyrics of these songs have been penned by Indeevar.\n\nSo many convicts in Indian jails are not actually criminals. Some may be victim of adverse circumstances and some may be totally innocent and wronged by others. Can&apos;t we have sensitive cops like Bhuvan Roy who can give importance to read the language of their tears and then try to wipe them ?"",""reviewRating""","[""Drama"",""Family""]","""1975-03-21""","{""total"":0","""2H33M""",47.0

First, it is the film debut of the talented Kajol. Secondly, it is directed by Rahul Rawail, some of whose films I had really enjoyed watching, and other than that, I had seen some clips from the film which looked worthy. But then I watched it, and I was completely disappointed. Bekhudi is pretty much the typical Hindi melodrama. It is one of those countless Hindi films centring around star-crossed lovers whose love is impossible blah blah blah, and follows their struggle to be together against all odds. The film, though starts pretty well, fails for the most part and suffers from extremely poor writing. The story is filled with clichés and the proceedings are ancient. That said, there were also a few points which made it watchable. First, Kajol. She made a confident debut and tried her very best throughout the film. Her character is that of a decisive and stubborn young girl and though it is nowhere close to being a particularly good performance, one could foresee the great actress that she would become seeing her dedication to the role. Secondly, Nadeem-Shravan composed a great soundtrack of some melodious songs. Asha Bhosle was the voice of Kajol and sang all the songs beautifully. The film also marked the debut of Kamal Sadanah, who played Kajol&apos;s boyfriend. He was also pretty good, though it was one of the few films he has appeared in and no one really knows who he is today. The supporting cast includes Kajol&apos;s real-life mother Tanuja as her mother, and Farida Jalal, Kulbhushan Kharbanda and Vijayendra Ghatge, among others. All of them were quite okay in their unimpressive roles. To sum it up, Bekhudi is not worth your time, but if you are a Kajol fan, you can take this one to watch her very first performance in a film. I think this reason is good enough."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Crime"",""Drama""]","""1992-07-31""","{""total"":0","""2H20M""",30.0

I feel sorry for this movie and the people associated with it when I read accolades for average but over-hyped movies. Saath Saath had got average box office success, neither a flop, nor a big hit. It had received admirations too but not the way, any 3 Idiots or My Name is Khan receives. The fact is, Saath Saath is simply an outstanding movie with several pluses to its credit - story, treatment, crispness of narration, performances and music. It provides entertainment, romance, laughs, thoughts to ponder and inspiration; all rolled into one. A gem of a movie by the director Raman Kumar.\n\nSaath Saath got released in 1982 with the charming next door pair of Farooq Sheikh and Deepti Naval and the timeless ghazals and nazms penned by Javed Akhtar, composed by Kuldeep Singh and sung by Jagjeet Singh and Chitra Singh. The story portrays how the might of money and hardships of life get the better of the ideals of an idealistic person. However a girl loving not just him but his ideals is not ready to compromise on this count for the sake of love, family or anything. When she is about to leave him, then he realises that he had digressed from his right path, his ideals. And then he stops his wrong steps getting the Saath or the state of togetherness with his sweetheart in return. The punchline of the movie comes in the end - Love does not mean looking at each other, it means looking together in the same direction. This punchline sums up the plot of the story and the intention of the storyteller.\n\nThe story starts with the college life love of Farooq and Deepti in which there are teasings and light moments provided by their buddies. After their love marriage, starts their hard life in which they hardly get any time to see each other, leave aside talking. All this has been portrayed in a highly emotional, natural and loving manner. Family responsibilities and circumstances lead Farooq to work in association with Satish Shah, a corrupt publisher whose thoughts centre around enhancement of cash inflow, by whatever means possible. Deepti who had married Farooq for the sake of his ideals only because his idealism was the foundation stone of her love towards him, is dumbfound to see the change in her husband and lover, courtesy the job and the company of Satish Shah. Farooq is getting more and more transformed from an idealistic person to a money-minded person, looking a pale shadow of his college days. Deepti&apos;s objections are not affecting him and this is something even more painful for Deepti. Finally Farooq&apos;s decision to get involved in publication of pornography proves the proverbial last straw on the camel&apos;s back for Deepti. She decides to leave him and his home and then only curtain fallen on the eyes of Farooq gets removed and he is able to see where he faltered.\n\nThe story and its narration both are heart-touching. The transformation of Farooq from a man of principles and ideals to a money-minded person has been shown quite realistically. It has reminded me of a legendary Hindi novel - Jhootha-Sach written by Yashpal which shows similar transformation of a patriotic and idealistic freedom-fighter in the wake of the changed scenario post independence. Farooq who says a SHER in the beginning - &apos;MAANA KI MAIN MAJBOOR HOON, LAACHAR NAHIN HOON, INSAAN HOON, BIKNE KO MAIN TAIYAR NAHIN HOON&apos; (I am hard-pressed ,yet not compelled to follow the wrong path, I am a human-being who is not ready to be sold for money), becomes more and more money-minded later on, giving justifications for his wrongdoings; looks utterly real. In the ending scene when Farooq conveys Deepti his decision to leave the wrong path and join his roll model, A.K. Hangal&apos;s newspaper, Deepti asks him whether he is doing it just for her sake; Farooq&apos;s reply simply touches the heart of the viewer - &apos;NAHIN, APNE LIYE BHI AUR UN SACHCHAIYON KE LIYE BHI JINHEN HAM DONO NE MILKAR PYAR KIYA THA&apos; (not just for your sake, for own sake also and also for the sake of those truths we had loved together).\n\nThe music of this movie is timeless, the performances of the lead pair Farooq and Deepti with the complete supporting cast are heart-warming, art direction and background score are perfect and good editing has kept the movie crisp and engrossing. A perfect movie.\n\nSaath Saath reminds you that when you love somebody, it is not just physical love or the love for his or her outer persona, the true love happens for the character, thoughts and inner nature of that person. That love remains intact only when both the lovers continue to look together in the same direction. That togetherness only matters and not just the physical togetherness. I strongly recommend Saath Saath to all those who are fond of watching good, intelligent and inspiring movies and have not watched this masterpiece yet."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama""]","""1982-03-04""","{""total"":0","""1H57M""",40.0

She knows that Anil is only waiting for her to die so that he can inherit the wealth and refuses to give him ..."",""","""Aan Milo Sajna (come and meet me O sweetheart) is the story of a college student Varsha (Asha Parekh) who during her vacation, decides to have an adventure and becomes the fake fiancée of a rich brat Anil Chaudhary (Vinod Khanna) posing as a poor girl Deepali who is doing it for money. Due to Anil&apos;s objectionable life-style, his widow mother Saavitri Devi Chaudhary (Nirupa Roy) dislikes him and has put a condition in her will that Anil will inherit her wealth only upon getting married to a suitable girl. And to win his old and ailing mother&apos;s trust in this regard, Anil brings Varsha aka Deepali to her in the village, showing her as his fiancée without knowing that the girl herself is not what she is posing to be. \n\nVarsha posing as Deepali now comes to know of Anil&apos;s greedy and wicked nature and his mother&apos;s disappointment with him but through her own good nature, she wins the heart of Saavitri Devi who is now glad that her spoiled son has chosen a nice girl as his life-partner. But Varsha&apos;s life becomes a complicated one when she falls in love with Ajeet (Rajesh Khanna) in the village. Ajeet is a boy with a heart of gold who always helps the people in the lower strata of the society and is ever ready to support their cause. He is also fatherless and lives with his widow mother (Dulaari) and younger brother Jaggu (Junior Mehmood). Romance blooms between them and now Varsha starts suffering from guilt-complex that on one hand she has hidden her true identity from all and on the other she is deceiving the innocent Saavitri Devi by making her believe that she would be her daughter-in-law while being in love with not his son but someone else.Besides, there is a back-story of the households of Ajeet and Anil also due to which Ajeet hates the Chaudhary family.\n\nThings take a bizarre turn when Ajeet&apos;s friend - Mohan (Sujeet Kumar) who has become a fugitive due to a false theft-charge levied on him, keeps on visiting his newly wed wife - Sita (Indrani Mukherjee) with complete secrecy with the help of his trusted friend, i.e., Ajeet who has faith in his innocence and is confident of getting him exonerated soon. Resultantly, Sita becomes pregnant but not able to tell the other members of the family as well as the world that her pregnancy is due to her clandestine meetings with her husband only. Villainous Anil comes to know of the different facts and on their basis, makes his own evil designs. And then one day, Sita is murdered with Ajeet being arrested under the charge of her murder. He is accused to be the father of the unborn child of pregnant Sita who killed her after coming to know of her pregnancy. The formula-based climax takes the story to its desired conclusion.\n\nAan Milo Sajna contains all the spices that make a delicious visual dish for the typical Indian audience. It has good romance between the stylish Rajesh Khanna and the gorgeous Asha Parekh. It has good comedy through comedians like Junior Mehmood, Rajendra Naath, Sunder etc. alongwith the lead pair itself. It has a typical Bollywood villain and his interesting conspiracies. It has family and social drama showing enmity between two households plus the everlasting conflict between the rich and the poor. It has action (the opening scene itself contains a horse-race) and courtroom drama. And it contains some very good songs The optimum mix of all these things proves to be a satisfying entertainment show for the audience that lasts for around three hours.\n\nProducer-director J. Om Prakash had a habit of keeping the titles of his movies as starting from the letter &apos;A&apos;. This movie is another link in the chain of his &apos;A&apos; titled entertaining movies. Since J. Om Prakash was able to pick up the pulse of the Indian audience very well, most of the movies made by him are damn entertaining and they were box office hits. Aan Milo Sajna is no exception. The movie does not bore at all and proves to be thoroughly engrossing for the viewer.\n\nTechnically, the movie is damn good. Beautiful rural locales are eye-candy for the spectator. Since both the rich household and the poor household are part of the script, the art-director had to differentiate between the two and he has done it quite effectively with both types of setting appearing as realistic on the screen. The wardrobe of the lead pair is damn impressive and trendy.\n\nMusic made by Laxmikant Pyarelaal with the lyrics of Anand Bakshi is very good with almost all the songs being popular ones. The title track has been sung by Lata Mangeshkar and Mohammed Rafi. However most of the male songs are in the voice of Kishore Kumar. Achchha To Hum Chalte Hain and Yahaan Wahaan Saare Jahaan Mein Tera Raaj Hai are Kishore&apos;s popular songs whereas Lata&apos;s solo Tere Kaaran Tere Kaaran and Asha Bhonsle&apos;s solo Palat Meri Jaan are also quite good to listen (and to watch). However my favourite song from this music album is Rafi&apos;s Koi Nazrana Lekar Aaya Hoon Main Deewana Tere Liye.\n\nRajesh Khanna&apos;s gimmicks and style had taken him on the top of the world then. He is present with all his mannerisms which are heart-conquering even today (in those days, they were just like a lightning for the young female hearts). His on-screen chemistry with Asha Parekh is praiseworthy and they look a lovely pair. Vinod Khanna is quite effective as the villain. \n\nSumming up, Aan Milo Sajna is an entertaining flick which won&apos;t disappoint any section of the audience. I wholeheartedly recommend it to the movie buffs of all categories."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama"",""Musical"",""Romance""]","""1970-12-24""","""horse,hit by a car,love,money,false accusation""","""2H57M""",52.0

Much to the chagrin of his pathologically arrogant wife, he likes to hang out with the poorer folks of the village and practice music and poetry with them. Leela only tolerates the poor folks when they pay tax. However, when she learns that her husband has used her money to help them, she has the village burnt down. This takes Shivnath to a new path.\n\nLike most of Mukherjee&apos;s film, &apos;Aashirwad&apos; is emotionally engaging and this one is more poetic than his popular works. Gulzar&apos;s poems and lyrics are beautiful and they are excellently recited by Kumar. I also liked the cinematography which was used very subtly. The script is mostly good. However, there are certain sequences that I failed to understand. After all, Shivnath only killed his accountant to protect Rukmini so why did he accept a murder plea? Moreover, a few scenes tend to be melodramatic especially the ending.\n\nSanjeev Kumar delivers a sincere performance with a natural charm and Sumita Sanyal has good screen presence. Sarika too is brilliant in a very small role and Veena, as usual, is good at playing the evil wife (and I liked that her character was humanized rather than demonized). However, &apos;Aashirwad&apos; is Ashok Kumar&apos;s film. He has a commanding presence without being too obvious. Natural, involving and heartbreaking are at least three words that describe his performance. I especially enjoyed his scenes with the children in the park and the grown-up daughter.\n\nEven though it tends to go overboard at times, like any Hrishikesh Mukherjee film, &apos;Aashirwad&apos; is definitely worth viewing. It showcases Ashok Kumar&apos;s talent. It&apos;s a heartfelt story about a father&apos;s love for his daughter.""},""aggregateRating""","[""Drama""]","""2019-03-09""","""gardener,court,wedding,doctor,death""","""2H26M""",54.0

And that is the reason why there are always at least 30-40 persons in the first show of these films expecting something better scaring them like never before. Plus these horror ventures also have a decent demand in the home video market too since the Ramsay era.\n\nUnfortunately the significant fact mentioned above is also known to many mediocre film-makers too which is repeatedly resulting in such silly and laughable products that not even qualify to be called as a Horror flick. In straight words, MUMBAI 125 KM once again proves that for few thoughtful minds a Horror film is nothing else than many dark scenes, shocking sounds, few flying spirits, some continuous brutal murders and a flashback secret served with a good dosage of sex and that&apos;s it. Now here if you think I missed out the word story or plot then for these specific minds, a group of friends going on to an expedition or adventure (with references taken from few foreign movies) is all which is required in the name of plot as displayed in this latest dud.\n\nDescribing the experience of watching this so called Horror film in few lines, it as usual starts with a scary dream sequence, followed by a party/love song introducing a group of friends (with a love triangle) deciding to go on a quick journey which obviously turns out to be spooky introducing a woman ghost with a linking twist. But giving out the actual truth this is certainly one of the most foolishly written and carelessly directed films that just has been made in 3D aiming at those 250 Rupees lying in your pocket and has nothing to do with the genre or even cinema in some exact words. And since I can easily sense your disinterest in reading about the film, there is no use writing about its performances, cinematography, background score, direction or script wasting your valuable time any further.\n\nHowever I would surely like to end with a simple request to the makers, that yes there are decent takers of this genre undoubtedly, but please don&apos;t consider them as fools serving such immature products repeatedly calling them as Horror films."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama"",""Horror"",""Mystery""]","""2014-10-17""","""party""","""1H40M""",8.0

He gets his goons to orchestrate a diamond heist, in which he gets double-crossed. As a result, bodies stack up, the diamonds are missing (and hidden in the titular Mumbai horse carriage Victoria No. 203), an innocent man is in jail for a crime he didn&apos;t commit, and now his daughter has to fend for herself. Oh, yeah, and there&apos;s tension between the rich guy and his son, and then his son meets the daughter of the innocent man...\n\nAll sounds very typical, right? All sounds cliché and predictable, right? So why am I rating this move 8/10? Quite simply, this movie belongs to Ashok Kumar and Pran. If there&apos;s one thing that none of the characters in this film predict, it&apos;s that they would have to deal with the fast-talking fresh-out-of-jail bumbling old crooks Raja and Rana. Pran&apos;s Rana, who is funny in his own right, plays the straight man to Ashok Kumar&apos;s Raja, a perpetually drunk skirt-chasing buffoon, and these two make up perhaps my favorite comedic duo in all of Bollywood history. (I have actually come to refer to any hilarious comedic duo as &quot;Raja and Rana&quot;.) When these two get thrown into the mix, this standard thriller plot suddenly takes a dramatic turn and sheer hilarity ensues.\n\nThis movie simply could not have worked without Raja and Rana and I don&apos;t think Raja and Rana could have worked if they hadn&apos;t been cast properly. This is especially true for Raja, as he is played by Ashok Kumar, an actor known for playing wise grandfatherly figures or strong authority figures (think Judge Badri Prasad in &quot;Kanoon&quot;). For him to play Raja, who goes chasing after women half his age and looks utterly ridiculous doing so, is a complete inversion of expectations, and that is exactly what is needed in solid comedy. And, here he is paired up with Rana, known in Bollywood for playing cheesy villains (not to mention the wise and elderly Malan-chaha from Manoj Kumar&apos;s classic &quot;Upkar&quot;). The duo&apos;s antics and especially their fast-paced dialogue (not to mention their classic musical number &quot;Do Bichare Bina Sahare&quot;) bring a smile to my face just remembering them.\n\nRaja and Rana are still supporting characters in this story, with the plot being driven by Navin Nischol as Kumar, the rich villain&apos;s good-guy son, Saira Banu as Rekha, the daughter-turned-carriage-driver, and Anwar Hussain as Durgadas, the rich villain. These performances would be considered weak for a thriller, but they are perfect for a comic thriller (or, perhaps, a comedy-masquerading-as-a-thriller) like this movie.\n\nYou don&apos;t watch this movie for the plot or for a thrill. You watch it because you get to see two of Bollywood&apos;s most serious actors do a complete inversion and become geniuses of comedy."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Comedy"",""Crime""]","""1972-12-08""","""woman wrapped in a towel,key,diamonds,robbery,double cross""","""1H40M""",50.0

The film is a close look at the goings on in a remote village in Northern India. So head for this film if you&apos;re in the mood for realism. But the film has a major drawback; its length. It could have been trimmed by at least half an hour and made crisp. Then it would have made a stronger impact! &apos;Chingari&apos; has many layers to it. It&apos;s the love story of a prostitute and a postman. There are other issues too that are still prevalent in these remote areas in the North; illiteracy, sexual exploitation of the poor, and fake Godmen.\n\nThere are some brilliantly executed scenes. Besides the performers, credit is due to Kalpana Lajmi, the director. Watch out for the scene in which Basanti goes to the post office a day before her marriage to confess her love to Chandan (Anuj Sawhney) and explain to him the reason for her agreeing to marry someone else is heart wrenching as well as performed from the heart. It shows the strong willed prostitute&apos;s transition into a woman.\n\nOne could also never associate this sort of vulnerability with the normally strong and confident Sushmita Sen! It puts her in the same league as some of our great actresses. Another brilliantly performed scene is one in which Basanti takes on Bhuvan Panda in her house. And the climax in which she kills him is just superb. She looks possessed by the Goddess. It&apos;s almost like Sushmita had recently said, &quot;It&apos;s not me, it&apos;s the Goddess herself!&apos; Mithun looks like he&apos;s truly made a comeback. This sensitive actor had somewhere got lost in all those flashy clothes and disco numbers in his yesteryear&apos;s. &apos;Chingari&apos; brings out the actor in him although he does go over the top in some scenes. Ila Arun fits the bill. Anuj Sawhney looks convincing. The kid who plays Basanti&apos;s daughter is cute. A couple of the songs are good. The background score is brilliant. There is a liberal usage of foul language, which goes with the genre of the film.\n\nBut the box office prospects of the film cannot be predicted. It has limited appeal.

You&apos;ve got the glamorous girls, the high crimes, and of course, you can&apos;t forget about Johnny Lever&apos;s comedy, as trite as it may be. Nonetheless, it gets boring very quickly. At the end of it all, you come out telling yourself, &quot;I can&apos;t believe I subjected myself to such stupidity.&quot; To keep consistent with the quality of cinema you&apos;re watching, the songs are also pretty lame."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy""]","""2005-01-28""","""man dresses as a woman,slapstick comedy,south africa,bank,toilet humor""","""2H42M""",17.0

A scathing take on the problems of urbanisation, Bhimsain&apos;s film starts off as a sweet love story where romance blooms between an affable man and a fetching young woman working together. They plan to settle down soon. There is that little question of a nest though giving Gulzar a wonderful opportunity to pen lines like &quot;Do deewane shaher mein aboodana dhoondte hain&quot;. The usage of the word &quot;aboodaana&quot; meaning water and grain, is an apt choice for a young couple looking for home and hearth.\n\nThey need a place of their own before getting married and soon realise that urban dwellings do not come easy. So, like the proverbial middle class couple they save every penny and put it all for a flat which is coming up. The problem is, and this is where modern day couples will find an echo, the flat never comes up. The builder dupes them of their money leaving them stranded. Not a place to call their own, nothing in the bank, not a penny in their pocket. So far so good. It is at this point that the film takes an unexpected turn with the still single hero suggesting to the heroine to get married to a rich old man, and wait for his innings to end shortly before the two of them get married. A little contrived but this is where Zarina&apos;s speaking eyes come into play. She holds her own as old man Lagoo&apos;s wife, nursing him back to life and health. Amol, meanwhile, is a picture of restraint as he alternates between simmering anger and plain hurt as the man waiting for his beloved to walk out of the nuptial match he himself suggested.\n\nThe story proceeds ever so slowly, just like you build a house, slowly, brick by brick. Once ready, &quot;Gharaonda&quot; gleams as afresh little apartment Bhimsain can own up with pride. But it was as much as Bhimsain as the lead trio -- Zarina, Lagoo and Amol, in that order, invest their roles with an easy identifiability and refrain from overstatements with ease.&apos;\n\nSo &quot;Gharaonda&quot; was all about middle class dreams made personably by the director and lead artists? No, There was more. That was Bhupinder&apos;s voice. His slipped into the character of Amol in two of the best songs of his well dotted career. &quot;Ek akeyal iss shaher mein&quot; and &quot;Do Deewana shaher main&quot; are two gems. Hardly surprising, that post &quot;Gharaonda&quot; Bhupinder went on to have a successful innings as the voice of an urban middle class hero with hits like &quot;Masoom&quot;, &quot;Ahista-Ahista&quot; and &quot;Aitbaar&quot;, etc. Then there was the Jaidev-Gulzar duo in sparkling form. Incidentally, Gulzar&apos;s words &quot;jeene ki wajah to koi nahin, marne ka bahana dhoondta hai....ek akela iss shaher mein&quot; found a reflection in spirit with Shehryaar&apos;s &quot;Seene mein jalan aankhon mein toofan sa kyun hai, is shaher mein har shakhs pareshan sa kyun hai&quot; a little later in &quot;Gaman&quot;.\n\nWith all these little buds, little twigs, &quot;Gharaonda&quot; remains a wonderful treat for lonely afternoons, silent nights. Fine, but what about the cinemas of the &apos;70s? Well, Kamal shut shop many summers ago, Chanderlok a few years back. And Ritz? It has had a stop-start innings too. &quot;Gharoanda&quot; though is for all seasons."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama"",""Romance""]","""1984-01-25""","""middle class,office,love,1970s,roommate""","""2H21M""",45.0

And now is the time when the same &apos;once unknown film&apos; is being followed by numerous &apos;average to poor&apos; clones trying to somehow repeat the success story, redefining the power in the concept of Destiny.\n\nJoining the same crew DILLIWALI ZAALIM GIRLFRIEND is another misdirected film made on the similar pattern of KKG wherein the &apos;plot of land&apos; is replaced by &apos;a car&apos; and the key character of &quot;Khurana i.e. Boman Irani&quot; is replaced by Jackie Shroff playing a Punjabi businessman quite amateurishly. In fact the weakest link of the film remains Shroff, a complete misfit for the character right from the word Go.\n\nBeginning with a short medley having the credits, the first thing that starts annoying you in DZG (within the opening 5 minutes only) is its loud background score heavily relying on the Punjabi beats having no relation to the proceedings whatsoever. The forcibly used Delhi lingo, the easily predictable routine plot and the poor show by the bank lady (in the initial sequences) straight away reveals the mediocre content coming next. But the film surprisingly falls to much lower levels featuring the songs being there exactly when they were least required creating a hilarious situation, like the sad one thrown in right after the scene where the hero loses his brand new car and doesn&apos;t know what to do. Moreover it becomes even worse when you notice the &apos;lip-sync&apos; completely out in the most famous track of the film composed and performed by Yo Yo Honey Singh (with Alfaz).\n\nPost intermission director Japinder Kaur desperately tries to impress the viewers with more vague insertions like the sequence shot at Gurdwara Bangla Sahib in Delhi and offers only one or two entertaining sequences in the final hour (that too not featuring anyone from the lead cast). The story dealing with a con and sting operations planned against Jackie Shroff is written so boringly (read childishly) that you feel like leaving the theater much before the film is officially over. Nevertheless the three otherwise good actors namely Divyendu Sharma, Pradhuman Singh and Ira Dubey keep trying hard to somehow save the film with their visible efforts (made in vain) but the terribly bad Jackie Shroff never allows them to do so in the entire two hours pathetically.\n\nAs per the new guidelines, Censor once again mutes all the cuss words used in the dialogues, that doesn&apos;t seem to be an unjustified act this time, since the writers have simply inserted those words to create a silly-funny impact that falls flat pretty badly. However it was quite weird to see a black patch pasted on the hands of characters showing their middle figure raising a valid question that what&apos;s possibly coming next from the Censor board in the name of moral policing.\n\nIn all, despite having some catchy party tracks in its multi- composer soundtrack that possibly were responsible of bringing in the young crowd in its first show itself, DILLIWALI ZAALIM GIRLFRIEND is not worth your valuable time and money, even in a free play on the cable to say it all."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Drama""]","""2015-03-20""","{""total"":0","""2H1M""",7.0

They name him Krishna, because the way they found him parallels the legend of how the god Lord Krishna came to live with his adoptive parents as a baby. Orphan Krishna (Namit Shah) lives happily in the orphanage with Kanta and Nattu and the other foundling children. But over the years, as one by one his other friends are adopted out to families but he remains, young Krishna comes to believe that he is unadoptable, unwanted, and will never find a family. In despair, all alone one night he goes to a temple and prays to Lord Krishna. Lord Krishna (animated) then comes to Earth in his mischievous childhood &apos;butter thief&apos; avatar and befriends the young orphan Krishna. Many adventures then ensue, as Krishna-from-Heaven helps Krishna-from-Earth discover his family.\n\nThe &apos;makhan chor&apos; Lord Krishna is charmingly designed and animated. He may be a god, but he never lets you forget that he is also himself a mischievous little boy, too. Animated Krishna&apos;s dual-level interactions with his new friend, orphan Krishna (well-played by debutant child actor Namit Shah), are not only engaging and believable but genuinely fun. The business with the kheer (rice pudding), for instance. Or what becomes the obsession of both Krishnas with their namesake Krishna character who becomes a superhero, as played by actor Hrithik Roshan in the &quot;Krrish&quot; movies.\n\nJuhi Chawla&apos;s performance here is outstanding, as the kindly headmistress of the orphanage. Even at her most perky and deliberately positive, you feel Kantaben&apos;s genuine love and caring for her young charges. Paresh Ganatra as her male counterpart is played more for comedy. But as the story progresses, the audience see and feel that he, too, shares her deep-seated concern for the orphans&apos; longterm future.\n\nAdults will particularly enjoy how ingeniously two real-world Hindi film superstars – first Katrina Kaif, later Hrithik Roshan – are cleverly worked into the story in 5-minute appearances as their actual selves.\n\n(First-time producers Nandan K. Mahto &amp; Promila Hunter are the longtime spot boy and hairdresser, respectively, of Mr Roshan and Ms Kaif, which is why the two superstars both readily agreed to support and be a part of their old friends&apos; debut movie. In industry terms such high-profile commitment would have been key to securing both funding and distribution for the project.)\n\nBut throughout &quot;Main Krishna Hoon&quot;, experienced children&apos;s director Rajiv S. Ruia (the &quot;My Friend Ganesha&quot; movie series) keeps the focus on children and completely child-friendly for all ages.\n\nFor instance, when actual villains are introduced into the story (in reference to the legendary battle of Krishna with the tyrant Kans) director Ruia presents the historic Krishna-Kans battle solely as animation, which lessens the potential fear factor to a child audience. The live action equivalent &apos;Kans&apos; – gangleader Angar Singh (Raj Premi), his lieutenant Paddu Singh (Rajan Verma), and their goons – are kept light and played for comedy. Even the gang&apos;s crimes are deliberately made crimes with which child audiences can instantly identify.\n\nThis is the sort of refreshingly straightforward movie where, if &apos;The Hero&apos; doesn&apos;t exactly ride into town on a white horse, he at least rides in on its 21st century equivalent!\n\nThe music by Amjad–Nadeem is generally good.\n\nJuhi Chawla herself beautifully sings &apos;Om Namo Namah&apos; over the opening credits, as we watch the infant orphan Krishna grow into the boy (Namit Shah) we will follow for the rest of the story.\n\nThe title track, &apos;Main Krishna Hoon&apos;, is catchy and stays with you.\n\nA particular highlight is &apos;Govinda Aala Re&apos;. The song is choreographed by ace dance director Ganesh Acharya against a traditional dahi handi human pyramid festival celebrating the birthday of young Lord Krishna. Aspiring stars Rajneesh Duggal and Misti Mukherjee appear briefly as the featured male and female dancers for this song.\n\nHindi cinema badly needs more good movies for children, which their parents can also enjoy. &quot;Main Krishna Hoon&quot; delivers!"",""reviewRating""","[""Animation"",""Family"",""Musical""]","""2013-01-25""","""bollywood musical""","""2H14M""",9.0

As you can tell, it&apos;s influenced by James Bond and heist films and is full of fights, car chases, gadgets and a villain with a steel hand with a blade attached. The villainy is high-level - you got three of them - Prem Chopra, Ajit and Manmohan Desai - and of course, you got Pran, but he&apos;s a good guy. There&apos;s also romance, nice songs and music background. Dharmendra is at the top of his form, and is equally good at romance, action and dialogue. Hema Malini is beautiful and her chemistry with Garam Dharam is amazing."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Drama"",""Thriller""]","""1973-08-30""","""character repeats someone else&apos;s dialogue,child murders an adult,statue,portrait,disguise""","""2H29M""",49.0

In science, it is asserted that opposite charges attract each other and similarly the opposite ends of the a magnet attract each other. And perhaps in the similar fashion (designed by the Almighty), opposite sexes attract each other, irrespective of cast, religion, race, province, language, appearance and age as well. Love has been facing challenges and opposition from multiple sides for ages, yet it survives. Kuchh Baat Hai Ki Hasti Mitati Nahin Hai Pyar Ki. Whether it&apos;s a palace or a hovel, whether it&apos;s a metro city or a very small remotely placed village, whether it&apos;s a posh area or a slum and finally the involved persons are children or the youth or the aged ones; love happens. It&apos;s the biggest gift of the Almighty to the mankind (in fact, almost all the creatures in this world). \n\nAs I have mentioned in the first para itself, opposite charges (and sexes) attract each other. Hence mutual attraction, infatuation and finally love can take place between a male and a female at any age and in any phase of life. When it can happen in young age, then why not in old age ? The functioning of heart and the sentiments embedded therein remains the same in the old age as it is in the young age. In fact, the fascination and the love in old age tend to be more mature and meaningful because it gets more platonic than sensual. \n\nAnd that&apos;s how this beautiful and touching movie has been made which I had seen in its year of release itself (2005). I sincerely thank esteemed MS reviewer, Deepa Swaminathan (@deepa.s) for inspiring me to write the review of this movie which I found very close to my heart when I watched it. It happens with many ladies (and gentlemen too) who, after devoting decades of their lives, including the complete youth phase, get nothing in return from the beneficiaries. What such lonely people do when life provides them a second chance to get their happiness and some worthy fellow&apos;s love ? Pyar Mein Twist provides the simplest answer - they should not let the opportunity go out of their hands and grab their share of joys and satisfaction too which they, as human-beings, are entitled to.\n\nInitially titled as Pal Tham Gaya (the moment paused) and later retitled as Pyar Mein Twist, this movie tells the story of two lonely fellows - Yash (Rishi Kapoor) and Sheetal (Dimple Kapadia) who are single parents and have spent almost the entire period of their golden years, fostering their children and managing their lives, ignoring their own. Life brings them together and then they have to make a decision whether to lead the remaining part of it as the erstwhile one or choose the option of living together with love of each other. The negative and non-understanding attitude of their children is the biggest obstacle with an additional one for the lady whose daughter (Soha Ali Khan) is engaged and she can ill-afford to let her image maligned before the would-be in-laws of her daughter lest the matrimonial alliance should be broken. However, her aunt (Farida Jalaal) gives her strength and encourages her to spend her remaining life for herself and not for the sake of others. And then our (now) aged pair of Bobby (1973) repeats its teenager act of Bobby itself by fleeing away from their homes without letting their family members know their whereabouts. The exercise of their respective families of searching them reduces the mental distances between the concerned people and finally they come to understand that their parents too are, after all, human-beings only and possess a right to love and be loved.\n\nDirector Hriday Shetty has handled this simple script quite skillfully and maintained interest for the viewers throughout. Technically the movie is OK. Music by Jatin-Lalit has nothing to boast of other than the repeated (in piecemeal) song - Pal Tham Gaya and the remix of a hit song from Rishi Kapoor&apos;s old movie, Khel Khel Mein (1975) - Khullamkhulla Pyar Karenge Hum Dono. However the biggest strength of this movie is its lead pair only. Obese, yet attractive, Rishi Kapoor and the ever-gorgeous Dimple have proved that they can recreate the Bobby magic even after a long gap of 32 years. They deserve a big hand indeed. The supporting cast, including the debutante Soha Ali Khan, has done its part well. Satish Shah and Farida Jalaal stand out and make their presence felt.\n\nAbraham Maslow kept love in the middle of the pyramid of his need hierarchy starting from physiological needs and reaching upto the need of self-actualization. However I consider it as the basic and the most important need for a sizable chunk of human-race. As stated above, those who do not love or give importance to love, also need love. And there is no rule that you cannot date with or romance with someone of your choice in the mature age. I salute Sahara India for producing such a loving and touching movie. If you put a premium on love, this movie is just for you only."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Drama"",""Musical""]","""2005-09-02""","""love,businesswoman,older couple romance,mother,father""","""2H3M""",17.0

She moves into Afghanistan only to realize the fraud her husband was. She is fed with the Sharia life, tries to escape twice to finally come back to ..."",""","""I am shocked to read the news of Sushmita Bandyopaadhyaay&apos;s murder in today&apos;s newspaper. The Indian authoress who wrote her true life story in the shape of a novel - Kaabuliwaalar Bengali Bou (Kaabuliwaala&apos;s Bengali Wife) was shot dead by the Taalibaani militants outside her residence in the Paktika province of Afghanistan. Sushmita had fallen in love with an Afghan businessman - Jaanbaaz Khan and shifted from Kolkata to Kaabul in 1989 after marrying him. After the emergence of an Islamic fundamentalist militant organization titled as Taalibaan (students) in 1993 and its capturing administrative powers, reducing the formal political regime to almost naught, life became hell for Sushmita there with certain very painful truths about her husband also coming out to fore which were hitherto unknown to her. She managed her escape from there through a lot of toil, hardship and struggle and penned down that phase of her life in the form of the above-mentioned book. This book got used as the basis of a Bollywood movie which is Escape from Taliban (2003).\n\nDirected by Ujjwal Chatterjee, Escape from Taliban features Manisha Koiraala in the lead role and Ali Khan in the role of her husband. The lady protagonist, i.e., Sushmita marries her Afghani lover despite opposition from her Bengali Hindu family but when moved to Afghanistan with him, she is horrified to see humanity being butchered in every particle of the land where it&apos;s a crime to be a non-Muslim and it&apos;s even greater crime to be a woman. She is rechristened as Sayeeda after conversion and gives birth to a baby child while living with her in-laws. Her humanitarian heart weeps for the oppressed innocents in this barbaric land. Some hidden truths about her husband also get revealed to her. Now she wants to be back to her motherland, i.e., India with her daughter but it&apos;s a Herculean task. How she is able to make this great escape happen forms the remaining part of the story.\n\nOver the past two decades of their reign, Taalibaan seems to be willing to take the world to the medieval era and convert it into Daar-ul-Islaam (the land of Islaam) where everybody is Muslim and leads his / her life according to the Sharia rule (as interpreted by them). They do not believe in giving the basic human rights and the bare minimum respect to the non-Muslims as well as the females (of all categories and communities) as well as those who do not support their ideology. They are cruel. They are insensitive. We have the latest example of a little girl Malaala Yousufzai who was shot by them because she was promoting education among Muslim girls. And quite unfortunately, their biased and condemnable ideology is directly / indirectly supported by several Muslim leaders and organizations all over the world including the so-called secular India. Sushmita vividly portrayed the pitiable condition of non-Muslims and females (of Muslims and non-Muslims alike) in her book and Ujjwal Chatterjee who has written the screenplay of this movie also, has done the same by making the celluloid version of the book with sincerity and honesty.\n\nAll the same, the movie is not an excellent one. It depicts reality and does not digress from its motive, nevertheless it&apos;s to be acknowledged that it could have been a much better one as the heart-tearing reality has not been portrayed with the amount of passion required for the purpose. The movie thrills more, moves less. With a better star cast and a better director, it could have been a masterpiece. At several places, the film appears to be just something above average which is sad considering the strength of the plot which is the much acclaimed book. The movie is technically okay though.\n\nVanraaj Bhaatia&apos;s music and Mehboob Kotwaal&apos;s lyrics have not created any chartbusters but all the songs are meaningful, admirable and perfectly in sync with the mood of the movie.\n\nManisha Koiraala has done well in the lead role. Ali Khan as her husband and the other members of the cast in various supporting roles have done justice to their work.\n\nWhile recommending this movie to all those who take interest in watching realistic, meaningful and purposeful movies, I wonder why Sushmita went back to that country after making such a daredevil escape from there. Perhaps because she was a sensitive lady and a true humanist and she went back only to help others like her. Ever since her return to the cursed land, Sushmita was ceaselessly busy in social work especially pertaining to women&apos;s healthcare and upliftment and that&apos;s what&apos;s not acceptable to the beasts who want to keep the half of the mankind as enslaved to the other half for eons to come.\n\nSushmita could manage an escape from Taalibaan during the nineties but now she has succumbed to their cruelty with little hope that this great sacrifice of hers will bring about any positive change in Afghanistan or the thinking of the fundamentalist Muslim brotherhood at any place. While paying my tribute to the brave Indian authoress, I take this opportunity to make an appeal to all the humanists of the world to rise up against this barbarianism and imposition of the outdated thinking and inhuman practices on the world. The so-called secular Indians may still not break their silence (they are ready to adjust to anything undesirable done in the name of Islam for the sake of their secularism which is nothing but maintaining of double standards for Muslims and non-Muslims). However all the humanists should join hands to save humanity and innocence from Taalibaan and similar outfits."",""reviewRating""","[""Adventure"",""Drama"",""Thriller""]","""2003-02-14""","""india,physical abuse,kidnapping,indian pakistani,wedding""","""2H46M""",19.0

I&apos;m so speechless to watch it again after 15 years long gap and it proves its greatness.\n\nBased on U R Anantmurthy&apos;s Kannada story &apos;Ghata-Shraddha&apos;, directed by Arun Kaul and made with the financial support of N.F.D.C. &amp; Doordarshan, the film is set in the time of early 30&apos;s some southern village. A Brahmin lost his five children after their birth and took a vow that if god bless him another child, he will surrender his life to God and make him true Vedpathi. It is emotionally so disturbing for eight or nine years sweet little Nanni to alienate from his parents, home and live a life in hostile new surroundings where he has to learn and unlearn something new from his strict disciplinarian Panditji (Manohar Singh) and bully classmates. Poor Nanni has to do his entire routine task himself at the tender age when he doesn&apos;t know how to tie his own dhoti. He made two good friends here-One is Panditji&apos;s widow young daughter and the other a lower caste orphan Koga (Nana Patekar) working as a servant to Panditji&apos;s ashram who in return get the food remains. Working in Brahmin house, he also abstains himself from meat and alcohol unlike others of his caste. During Panditji&apos;s absence, his young widow daughter in a weaker moment seduced by a local teacher and got pregnant. The lover is coward and not ready to accept his responsibility. Poor lady has to abort. Before Panditji back to ashram, the whole village Brahmins and folk come to know about this secret affair and forced Panditji to give a landmark decision.\n\nNana Patekar maintained his small but significant presence true to its salt with South Indian accent and characteristic body language. His act here is something which you won&apos;t forget in your experience. Watch the scene where he shows his raw anger to long back Panditji. Manohar Singh, K K Raina, Vijay Kashyap and almost all other cast had acted their parts with utmost sincerity and dedication to their profession. But the most memorable character comes from the little boy. \n\nThe film portrays the conflict between a humanitarian Brahmin Vs a rigid hypocrite Brahmin. The film becomes tragic and raises so many disturbing questions, which is a sign of Anantmurthy&apos;s powerful social reforming story &amp; Kaul&apos;s complete authentic adaptation. It raises many root questions in the end that social reformers have been asking from centuries- Who is &apos;True Brahmin&apos; here? One who is Brahmin by birth that preaches religion and follows Holy Scriptures or one who is Shudra and follows the religion of humanity with all his nobility and selfless act? \n\nHighly recommended to catch it either on torrent or original, I assure you don&apos;t regret it.\n\nRatings-10/10 (and there&apos;s no exaggeration here, the film deserves at least this much.)"",""reviewRating""", , , ,"""2H""",31.0

He is passionate about music which is strongly disliked by his father. Hence he adopts a pseudo-name for his artistic life - Sanjay. However his father kicks him out of his home and he moves to the house of his motor-mechanic friend - Bhisham Singh (Asrani) and his wife (Preeti Ganguly). Now he happens to meet the love of his life too - Sunita (Simple Kapadia), the grand-daughter of Mr. Mathur (Ashok Kumar). He changes his name once again to Preetam Nath Ghayal and gets the job of a chauffeur in the house of his sweetheart.\n\nOn one track, this rom-com runs to delight the audience, on the other, runs the pain-soaked story of Arun&apos;s another friend - Shrikant (Vinod Mehra) who is a poet and lives with his widow mother (Nirupa Roy) under extreme poverty. At their hearts, himself and Arun are no less than real brothers. He authors lyrics for the songs of Arun. He has been caught by tuberculosis but he hides his disease from his mother as well as Arun. Though Arun never appears on the stage for a live show (he sings on radio only), he has to change his decision to arrange a huge sum for the operation of his beloved friend Shrikant whose decease he comes to know of quite late. It is then the song mentioned in the title and the first para of this review, comes before the audience. The movie ends on a happy note.\n\nContrary to some of the heavy dose of sentiments in the reviews above, this film was a major failure at the box office and the only reason it gets a 7 from me his due to the memorable performance by Vinod Mehra.\n\nVinod Mehra&apos;s outstanding performance in his inimitable style is the heart and soul of the emotional drama presented on the screen. His performance in Anurodh is an unforgettable one. The ailing, full of self-respect, yet suffering from guilt-complex to create troubles for his beloved ones, poet Shrikant who pens poems of hope and optimism but forced by the misery prevailing in his life to decide to kill himself has been enlivened by Vinod Mehra on the screen.\n\nRajesh Khanna was past his heyday when Anurodh was released. However he also gives a delightful especially his outburst before Shrikant when he comes to know that Shrikant has been suffering from TB and may not live beyond a few days, is able to leave indelible imprint upon the viewer&apos;s heart. Ditto about his performance in the climax when he appears in person before the music lovers for the first time in his life and appeals to them to pray for Shrikant&apos;s life. No one can lip sync Kishore da&apos;s melodious tunes as effortlessly as Rajesh Khanna and the actor&apos;s mannerisms are with so much elan.\n\nBut truth must be told that Vinod Mehra despite being in a supporting role, outshines and outclasses Rajesh khanna here.\n\nThis is the debut movie of Dimple Kapadia&apos;s younger sister, (late) Simple Kapadia (Rajesh Khanna&apos;s real life sister-in-law) and she is just okay. The complete supporting cast has done exceedingly well to complement the performance of the lead characters (Arun and Shrikant).\n\nLaxmikant Pyarelal have composed outstanding music for this movie. On one hand, there are romantic songs like - Aate Jaate Khoobsurat Aawaara Sadkon Par, Aapke Anurodh Pe Main Ye Geet Sunaata Hoon and Mere Dil Ne, but my all-time favorite is the song that ends the climax. Brilliant rendition.\n\nA good film all in all, but the reasons why it failed at the box office was understandable.\n\nWatch this movie for the Melodious tunes of Laxmikant-Pyarelal, Kishore Kumar&apos;s beautiful rendition most notably and of course, the power house performance by Vinod Mehra who was simply brilliant and deservingly got a Filmfare nomination for Best Actor in a supporting role."",""reviewRating""", , , ,"""2H27M""",45.0

Punjabi cinema has its own flavor of comedy that mostly remains dependent upon its witty one liners and taunting dialogues instead of any active slapstick comedy of making faces. Whereas Hindi cinema does require a fine mix of all and cannot sustain for 2 hours just on supposedly funny lines and few messy situations alone.\n\nB. It seems the film&apos;s dialogues were first written in the regional language and then translated into Hindi, as at few places, Punjabi words or phrases have been used as it is. Moreover the &quot;Tu-Tera&quot; in the lines instead of &quot;Tum-Tumhara&quot; sounds pretty awkward right from the beginning.\n\nC. There is a typical Punjabi feel throughout in the film, particularly due to the verbal expressions used in the irritating, loud background score repeatedly. Moreover the lead hero Gippy Grewal has a strong, unintentional regional tone in his dialogue delivery ruining even the potential scene or a potent dialogue at times.\n\nD. Though the film has an interesting plot woven around divorce and alimony, its writing and visuals both lack that required finesse on the screen. For instance, a practicing lawyer herself is not clear about the case &amp; its judgment she was fighting. Plus in a scene at police station we can see four policemen wearing dresses of four Khaki shades adding to the stale comedy.\n\nE. Director Smeep Kang ropes in few comic actors from Punjabi cinema as Gurpreet Ghuggi, Karamjit Anmol &amp; Rajiv Thakur along with many known names of Hindi films as Alok Nath, Mukesh Tiwari, Ravi Kissen, Rati Agnihotri, Deepshikha and more converting it into a film led by the supporting cast instead of its key stars. Yet none of them delivers anything worth mentioning except Vijay Raaz and Sanjay Mishra in their individual scenes.\n\nF. With a routine cinematography it has a couple of good songs as &quot;Rabb Varga&quot; and&quot;Channa&quot; (that is take-off from a traditional Punjabi song &quot;Chann Kithan Guzari&quot;).\n\nG. Addressing the young lead actors, Gippy Grewal should move back to the world where he is a superstar as he is now done with the dream of featuring in a Hindi film.Tina Ahuja looks confident but she should have chosen another project for her debut with a better written role having at least some chemistry on screen as a love bird. And I wonder why Geeta Basra doesn&apos;t get some big projects since she simply looks stunning on screen (with a comic timing too) becoming the only positive feature of this dull comedy (also featuring Bhajji in a scene towards the end).\n\nH. As a friendly advice for director Smeep Kang, he has got an already proved talent that can easily deliver an enjoyable comedy unarguably. But for a Hindi film, he needs to re-invent himself in entirety coming out of the hard Punjabi shell taking a new avatar.\n\nI. In the end coming to one of my most loved actors Dharmendra, would only like to say that I highly respect those veterans who are blessed with the insight of when to quit keeping their respectable image intact like Dilip Kumar. And that should say it all in an indicative way about our beloved He-man&apos;s questionable portrayal in the film."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Romance""]","""2015-07-03""","""remarriage,flirting,alimony,husband wife relationship,employer employee relationship""","""1H45M""",7.0

It is a lighthearted story about three guys, one of whom (Dharmendra) is heir to the throne of the murdered King Maharaja. He disappeared in childhood, and the king&apos;s extremely loyal assistant (Pran) still looks for him, as much as he does for his own son (Mithun) who disappeared on that same day and who happens to be one of the trio. Well, the film follows the story of the three guys (the third being Danny, by the way), their stories, their struggles and their romances. Amrish Puri plays the typical villain who killed Maharaja and who is also the father of Mithun&apos;s love interest Usha. Well it will not look that complicated when you see the film as much as it sounds now. The story is refreshing, well-narrated and interesting. It&apos;s essentially an action film but has its substantial share of drama and romance. The visuals are great - there&apos;s buried treasure, underground houses (located under a cemetery!), the cinematography is good, and the film is set in modern-day Calcutta (well it&apos;s 1982 of course). The actors do a good job. The three guys are great, the two girls (Zeenat Aman and Shoma Anand) look good. Pran and Amrish Puri are as always terrific in their respective roles and actually those whom I liked the most in this film. The best thing about the film is in my view R.D. Burman&apos;s exceptional soundtrack. The songs are fantastic - and I must note &quot;Aaj Ki Raat&quot; and &quot;Chor Tera Naam Hai&quot; which are my favourite. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and I recommend this to those who enjoy Hindi commercial flicks."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Adventure"",""Drama""]","""1984-10-26""","""falcon,boy,disguise,servant,binoculars""","""2H15M""",38.0

John has got all the bad habits one can think of, he hangs around with his hooligan friends stealing, drinking, going to brothels and beating up whores etc etc. Amitabh has planned something different for the weekend and takes the daughter away for a song routine at a scenic location. When Bips does not turn up he goes all wild and decides to show up at Bips house. Where as expected the lovers are caught by the Dad. Amitabh asks Bips to call him for tea, where Amitabh realises he has seen John somewhere, but can,t remember. The rest of the story is about how Amitabh finds out who John is and decides to save the daughter from his clutches. The story is nothing home to ride about and has been seen in a earlier movie of the same director &quot;Inteha&quot;. Technically movie is slick. Music very functional. Amitabh is the only saving grace. Bips is badly miscast as the innocent lass.

Nafisa Ali is pretty likable, and is still beautiful and full of grace, but unfortunately she too does not really play the traumatised rape victim that convincingly. Maybe it&apos;s got more to do with her appearance and overall dignified persona which comes across very clearly on-screen and which makes it hard to believe that she had ever gone through such an experience.

It&apos;s founded upon a couple of beloved concepts for Indian films -- arranged marriages and identical twins.  Here we have Kanchan (Rakhee), lovely but just misses being cloying, a traditional girl who loves animals and moves in a brilliant-colored setting that looks like fantasy Kashmir recreated on a Disney soundstage.  Her problem?  She&apos;s shy and nobody wants their sons to marry her.  Everytime a prospective mom-in-law comes over, it winds up as, &quot;Can&apos;t we have the fun sister, Kamini, instead of that dull Kanchan?&quot; Under the circumstances, you can hardly blame the girl for being shy and self-effacing.\n\nTwin Kamini (also Rahkee) is a westernized chick, and would demand that noun, I&apos;m sure.  This being a 1971 film, she looks sorta like she&apos;s dressing herself out of SEVENTEEN magazine, about 1967.  She&apos;s very outgoing and has a bunch of swinger friends she likes to spend time with, going on vacations to the Himalayas &amp;c.  During the latter, she has a meet-cute encounter with army officer Ajit (Sashi Kapoor).  kamini steals food from the army base for herself and her friends, and Ajit tracks her down to the lodge where they&apos;re all staying.  A musical number leads to love, as it always does in Hindi films.  But she and her friends catch the midnight train to Georgia, leaving love-struck Ajit with those &quot;I Wonder Where She&apos;s Gone Blues.&quot;\n\nMeanwhile, Ajit&apos;s foster dad and the twins&apos; parents decide that Ajit would be a great match for the difficult to marry off Kanchan.   When the two are introduced, natch, Ajit thinks she&apos;s the same hottie he met up in the mountains and he&apos;s ecstatic.  Kanchan thinks it&apos;s herself that he has these feelings for and falls deliriously in love, up to a gorgeous bright pastel pregnancy fantasy that has even an old crab like the 12-stringer going, &quot;Awwww... &quot;  Until the real Kamini shows up and Ajit realizes his mistake in identification, and, just like everybody else, he demands the other sister.  Now we have plot complication.\n\nOut of the blue the filmmakers spring it on us that Kamini is not just the free spirit we&apos;ve been spending time with, but rather, what those of us in backwoods West Virginia would spell S.L.U.T.  It&apos;s an out of the hat, rather than a payoff of anything we&apos;ve been prepped for.  But it leads to quite a dramatic plot turnaround, and not nearly the last in this story.\n\nFor the rest of it, you need to watch the movie.

The ordinary ones attach themselves to the narrative, usually the spoken narrative, so we get faces and clear, ordered speech to tell us what is going on. These are the most formulaic because there are after all only so many stories that are presentable.\n\nSome attach themselves to characters, dig in and let those characters deliver a tale and situation. Often with the Italians and Italian-Americans, the camera swoops on a tether attached to these characters. I consider this lazy art unless there is some extraordinary insight into the relationship between actor and character.\n\nAnd then there the few who attach themselves to a sense, a tone, a space. That situation has ideas and stories and talk, but they are only there as reflections from the facets of the place. Of the three, this is the hardest to do well; that&apos;s why so few try. And of those that do, most convey style only, not a place, not a whole presentation of the way the world works.\n\nThis film is about the best example I know where the world is &apos;real,&apos; the situation governs everything and the primary substance is the presentation of a Shakespearian quality cosmology of fate.\n\nThe camera moves not so much with the story, but it enters and leaves. And there is not just one story, but many that we catch in glimpses. Words just appear in disorder as they do in life. Not everything is served up neat. We drift with the same arbitrariness as McCabe. It is not as meditative as &apos;Mood for Love&apos; as it has something we can interpret as a story to distract us.\n\nSo as a matter of craft, this is an important film, one with painful fishhooks that stick. Beatty had already reinvented Hollywood with &apos;Bonny,&apos; and was a co- conspirator in this. (If you are into double bills, see it with &apos;The Claim,&apos; which is intended as a distanced remake/homage, that obliquely references Warren.)\n\nQuite apart from the craft of the thing, and the turning of the Western on its head long before &apos;Unforgiven,&apos; there are other values","[""Drama"",""Western""]","""1972-06-23""","""prostitution,brothel madam,mining town,bordello,gambler""","""2H""",51.0

However, Ashok is in love with Asha. Things take a turn when Ashok loses his eyesight in an accident."",""","""oy Mukherjee passed away on 09.03.2012. He was the first Bengali hero to have played a more than one decade long successful innings in Bollywood as a romantic hero with his clean-shaven chocolaty looks (Biswajeet followed suit). Joy was so beautiful that it might have been pretty difficult for the young Indian girls during that period to control themselves whenever he smiled romantically. Joy gave many hits during the sixties. He made a successful on-screen pair with Asha Parekh with three hits to its credit - Phir Wohi Dil Laaya Hoon (1963), Ziddi (1964) and Love In Tokyo (1966).\n\nLove In Tokyo is a formula-based movie produced and directed by Pramod Chakravarty. Joy Mukherjee&apos;s mother - Lalita Pawar sends him off to Japan to bring his nephew and her grandson who is an orphan now because both his father, i.e., Joy&apos;s elder brother and his mother who was a Japanese woman, are no more. But Joy finds it difficult because the child loves Japan and not willing to shift to India. Joy happens to come across Asha Parekh who has her own problem of a marriage being forced on her by her greedy uncle. The groom decided for her is Pran who is a criminal-minded person and he has cooked up a plan with her uncle to usurp her inheritance through that marriage. Asha runs away from her home and crosses path with Joy and his nephew. One side track of Joy&apos;s friend - Mehmood also runs in parallel who has been sent by Joy&apos;s mother to Japan to bring both Joy and the child to India but he has his own axe to grind, i.e., marrying his sweetheart, Shubha Khote who is in Japan. The story reaches its expected happy finale after many romantic and comic scenes and twists in the tale.\n\nIt&apos;s a good rom-com with highly popular songs composed by Shankar-Jaikishan and very good photography capturing the scenic beauty of Japan. The movie had been shot in Japan just after the Tokyo Olympics were over in 1964. However it&apos;s too long (168 minutes duration) and the side track of Mehmood though entertains, has been dragged just too much. In those days, the Indian audience was not habitual to watch movies having a duration lesser than two and a half hours. Hence long movies of 150-170 minutes duration were made so that the audience would feel to have got it&apos;s money&apos;s worth. However had the director and the editor trimmed this movie by 18-20 minutes, it would have become more engrossing and entertaining. Due to this excessive length, the movie actually starts boring at some places.\n\nHowever, overall, it renders an entertaining experience to the spectator. It&apos;s a coloured movie and it&apos;s a visual treat to watch the colourful beauty of Japan (and the Japanese women) on the screen as well. Guru Dutt&apos;s close associate - V.K. Moorthy has used his camera with a high degree of proficiency. Even the titles at the beginning of the movie, appear on handmade beautiful paintings in a highly aesthetic manner. Action and thrills are also up-to-the-mark from the standards of that time.\n\nBesides being a visual treat, Love in Tokyo is a musical treat too because of the efforts of Hasrat-Shailendra (the lyricists), Shankar-Jaikishan (the composers) and Rafi-Lata (the singers). Songs like Le Gayi Dil Gudiya Japan Ki (which is the title track), O Mere Shah-e-Khubaan, Saayonara, Mujhe Tum Mil Gaye Humdum, Koi Matwala Aaya Mere Dwaare, Aaja Re Aa Zara etc. are all melodious and memorable. Manna Dey has, like always, given his playback for Mehmood for the song - Main Tere Pyar Ka Beemaar Hoon, Kya Arz Karoon.\n\nThe dialogues of Agha Jaani Kashmeri are impressive, especially the romantic lines of Joy. And with the help of them (and his own lady-killer personality), Joy has delivered a touching romantic performance. His on-screen chemistry with Asha has always been admirable and hence Asha also, with her limited talent, done satisfactorily. Her dancing talent has also been used in the song - Koi Matwala Aaya Mere Dwaare. Mehmood had earned a lot of fame as a comedian during the sixties. He is in full form with his permanent on-screen heroine - Shubha Khote and permanent on-screen (would-be) father-in-law - Dhumal. Pran is a hateable baddie as he always was in that time. The child artist - Master Shaahid has also delivered a lovely performance. Lalita Pawar is perfect as the old-fashioned mother.\n\nAll in all, Love In Tokyo is an entertaining movie filled with romance, music and comedy and renders a nice timepass in the style of the sixties. I pay my tribute to late Joy Mukherjee through this"",""reviewRating""", , , ,"""2H44M""",56.0

His son, Jaipal, takes over as the Maharaja, turns rebel, and refuses to hand over his title and kingdom to the Government. It ..."",""","""The story of Rajput starts with two families belonging to the warrior race (the Rajputs). The first family is of Thakur Sangraam Singh (Om Shivpuri) who has two songs - Maanu (Dharmendra) and Bhaanu (Vinod Khanna) whereas the second family is of Thakur Prataap Singh (Rehman) who has a daughter - Jaanaki (Hema Malini). There is a very old feud between these two families but as always happens in Indian movies - Maanu and Jaanaki fall in love with each other. Jaanaki gets pregnant through Maanu but their marriage cannot materialize and she is married by her father (ignorant of her pregnancy) to a police officer - Dhirendra (Rajesh Khanna). When the groom and his companions (Baaraat) are going back to their place with the bride in the sedan, they are attacked by the bandits who are trying to snatch the bride (i.e., Jaanaki) away from them. Dhirendra fails their attempt but meantime he gets a false impression as if Jaanaki has been raped by a bandit. In fact, that bandit was killed by Maanu who gets arrested and sentenced with long imprisonment by the court. Dhirendra comes to know of his wife&apos;s pregnancy and considers it a result of the rape that had taken place with her (as per his own knowledge and belief). However Jaanaki herself tells him that the pregnancy is the result of her love for someone else. Thereafter Dhirendra who actually loves his wife very much, avoids conjugal relationship with her but does not allow it to be known to anybody in his household. Jaanaki gives birth to a son who is loved very much by his foster father - Dhirendra very much. \n\nThe bandits who had attacked Dhirendra, Jaanaki and the group (Baaraat) belong to a former king of an erstwhile princely state who is not ready to accept the reality even after the merger of the state with the Union of India after the independence of the nation. This person is but natural another Rajput (a person having royal blood in his veins) - Jaipaal Singh (Ranjeet). He is licentious and one day he rapes Bhaanu&apos;s sweetheart - Kamli (Ranjeeta). Considering herself as impure now (from the viewpoint of becoming Bhaanu&apos;s wife), Kamli becomes Jaipaal&apos;s keep and gives birth to his son. Jaipaal is still extracting money from the people considering himself as still the king and the people of the locality as still his subjects. Moreover, he is a clandestine bandit too, looting the people in the darkness of night while maintaining his clean image before the government authorities in the daylight.This continuous harassment of the people of the area leads Bhaanu to take up arms against the attackers. He rechristens himself as Bhawaani and becomes a bandit himself. However he is not a bandit for the commonfolk. He becomes a bandit to take on the real bandits. Now the frequent tussles keep on taking place between the real bandits led by Jaipaal and the modern Robinhood - Bhaanu now known as Bhawaani.\n\nYears pass. The son of Jaanaki has become a schoolgoing boy. Jaanaki has patched up with her husband - Dhirendra and living a happily married life in her home. Dhirendra has also elevated in his rank and still in search of the bandits who could not have been eliminated over these years and still they are a terror in the area. Maanu is released from jail after his sentence is complete and happens to meet Jaanaki. He is glad to see that he has a lovely son and his foster father - Dhirendra loves him very much. He is also glad to see Jaanaki&apos;s marital bliss. Now, after finding out that his younger brother - Bhaanu has become a bandit to take on the real bandits, he joins hands with him.\n\nOne day Bhaanu suddenly comes across Kamli and the painful tale of her rape and giving birth to a son becomes known to him. He forces Jaipaal to marry Kamli and acknowledge her son as his own. Meantime, the legitimate daughter of Jaipaal - Jayakaamini (Tina Munim) who had been studying abroad, comes back to India. To teach Bhaanu a lesson as well as to misguide the police, Jaipaal arranges a false attack of bandits on himself and his people but Bhaanu takes advantage of this situation and checkmates Jaipaal by kidnapping Jayakaamini during the pandemonium of that false attack turning into a real fight between his gang and Jaipaal&apos;s gang. Jayakaamini first hates her kidnapper but after coming to know of the reality of her father and Bhaanu&apos;s endeavours to protect innocents from the loots of her father, she starts loving him. The action-packed climax culminates in Maanu&apos;s sacrifice in his bid to save the life of Jaanaki&apos;s son (whose biological father is himself only) and elimination of Jaipaal and his gang.\n\nThis story is much better, interesting, moving and impressive when watched on the screen. I was fortunate to watch it on the big screen but even on the small screen, this thrilling and sentimental movie is a treat to watch. Technically the movie is just superb and all the fight and chase sequences have been executed with finesse. \n\nAll the principal male stars - Dharmendra, Vinod Khanna and Rajesh Khanna have done well in association with the female leads - Hema Malini, Ranjeeta and Tina Munim. The child artist has also impressed as the little son of Jaanaki. \n\nMelodious tunes composed by Laxmikant Pyarelal with the beautiful lyrics of Anand Bakshi is the icing on the cake. The two songs have been given voice by Rafi, Kishore, Asha, Mahendra Kapoor, Hemlata, Dilraj Kaur, Manhar Udhaas etc. \n\nIf you want to watch a thoroughly interesting multi-starrer movie with a brilliant mix of action and sentiments, Rajput is the right choice for you. It has good repeat value and one who likes it will always be tempted to watch it again."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Drama"",""Romance""]","""1982-04-16""","""bandit,marriage,love,revenge,attempted kidnapping""", ,40.0

Months later, a private investigator is trying to track her down."",""","""Beginning with a couple speaking about their affair in broken Punjabi, followed by a fake Sikh character given a weird get up and all forced lines just to create some silly laughs, BADMASHIYAAN straight away gives you the feeling of an amateurish attempt by the team in its first five minutes itself making a bad impression. The poor show (set in Chandigarh) continues till the next 30 minutes till you get to know that it&apos;s actually all about a con-woman and her innocent romantic victims desperately looking for their true love that instantly makes you recall LADIES V/S RICKY BAHL or the recent DOLLY KI DOLI revolving around few similar concepts.\n\nProgressing further introducing more of its key characters, it frankly looks like one of those self-sponsored projects by the new actors themselves, since none of them is able to make any kind of noticeable impact on the viewers. The narration fails to hold your interest for most of its duration (divided into three sections) and it all starts falling in line towards the finale only with some kind of freshness and interesting moments.\n\nActually the three distinctive plot lines in its script have been thought well but not written accordingly creating boredom in the middle and the same can be said about its direction too giving you nothing to praise in those two hours with performances ranging from below average to just bearable. The whole film revolves around the character of Suzanna who plays it over dramatically looking good only in a few sequences and Sidhant as her lover seems like a clone of Sushant Singh Rajput playing it poorly. Among the more experienced ones, Karan Mehra&apos;s act remains highly inspired from Shah Rukh Khan throughout whereas the debutant Gunjan Malhotra turns out to be the decent one as compared to the rest. Surprisingly Sharib Hashmi of FILMISTAAN fame is not able to give any extraordinary performance here as the Don, but he still remains the best among them all underplaying the role as required. \n\nContinuing the poor show in its music and background score, BADMASHIYAAN is not at all funny or thrilling as per its exciting con theme. And the only time you feel like seeing something engaging is the climax wherein all twists and turns get revealed interconnecting the three subplots together in an interesting manner (that again makes you recall many English films based on this specific format).\n\nSo one might not mind watching the film on a channel along with some multitasking going on utilizing the two hours, but opting for it at a costly multiplex is certainly not recommended."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Romance""]","""2015-03-06""","""night""","""2H8M""",7.0

In many ways, Jallaad is a B-grade movie, but it&apos;s an entertainer, and no film starring Chakraborty is a complete waste because his presence is always forceful. Director Prasad does his best - the songs are well shot, the development of the story is passable, and the film would be quite watchable for fans of Hindi films, despite the regular absurdities. A slightly aging Mithun plays two roles, that of a father and his illegitimate son. While the role of the son is a pretty common role and a sort of replica of his many parts in previous films, it is the role of the evil, sadistic father that offers this star-actor an opportunity to showcase his thespian talent. And what a talent it is. The way he transforms into that character is beyond words - the look in his eyes, the tiny gestures, the cynical smile, the body language, and the voice - there isn&apos;t a false note and the attention to detail is astounding. Sadly, the film doesn&apos;t quite live up to his work, but he rises above it so kudos to him for that."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Drama""]","""1995-09-15""","""murder,astrologer,prediction,politician,election""","""2H24M""",27.0

Yes, one of the best aspects of Gulabi Aaina or The Pink Mirror is that the urban Indian gay male-mainly drag queen, yes, but also the &apos;straight acting&apos; one is mirrored on screen. And being able to relate to the characters makes the film more funny, more touching for this audience more than for any other. No, the non-Indian audience, of any sexual orientation, will definitely find it entertaining too. Most Indian, straight, male viewers though may not approve of the in-your-face sexuality of Shabo and Bibbo. Their appearance, their language, their body language will, of course, be termed coarse, and, by some, even obscene--as the Indian censors termed it. i shall not go into the debate over definitions of obscenity but suffice to say that the film is not obscene, especially in comparison with some of the pretentious stuff that passes for art or the obscenely expensive trash that is hyped by the media. In Gulabi Aaina, Sridhar has presented reality--it may not be everyone&apos;s reality, it may even embarrass the same people it portrays, but it&apos;s a wickedly funny truth that you see in the mirror. Now, why an eight rating... (by the way, i can&apos;t comment on the technical aspects or the sub-titling in English) The acting is not perfect--it would be obvious that this is a cast relatively new to being in front of the camera. overall the bitchiness of the two drag queens is overdone, to the point where it acquires a tinge of harmful meanness. the HIV angle is at least a little contrived, maybe even unnecessary. sometimes the indulgent singing by the characters goes on for far too long...(maybe, Sridhar could have managed to cut down the film just enough to qualify this as a short film.) these are some minor irritants to an otherwise enjoyable film."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Short""]","""2016-04-28""","""transgender woman,indian,gay,india,drag queen""","""40M""",19.0

The storyline is weak, with several unwanted characters that torment the viewers brutally. Then their are hopeless stars like Rajindernath and Huma Khan, who fail to create an oasis in this far stretched desert. The movie could have been better if it were lessened by an hour. Unfortunately, during 80&apos;s it was a custom to make long movies and all the movie-makers were concerned more about time than viewer&apos;s patience. Kamran Rizvi has failed as a hero as most of the times he relies on his sidekick Hemant Birje to face the enemies.\n\nSince many sub-plots are interlaced, they all tend to kill the real spirit of movie. For example, the plot of Kamran Rizvi and Aarti Gupta, Hemant Birje and Priti Sapru, Imtiaz Khan and his confederates, The story of two sisters who separated during childhood, Imtiaz Khan&apos;s rape story, and Punit Issar and his plot. So where are we heading? There is virtually no space left for horror and the monster seems to be the most wanted character all the times. When the movie started I began giggling but as the movie progressed my giggles turned into loud hysterical laughter. Believe me, if you haven&apos;t watched it yet, you&apos;re lucky. There is nothing in the movie that has the ability to impress the viewers. Some dialog deliveries seem very foolish and comedic spell by Rajindernath is torturous to its best.\n\nThe star cast is mostly borrowed from other Ramsay hits but they weren&apos;t any better than puppets performing at the stale and awkward story line.

Namely, Natalie Portman, Nicole Kidman, Ellyn Burstyn, Demi Moore, Charlize Theron, Helena Bohman Carter, Emma Thompson, Hillary Swank, and Cameron Diaz. They have shaved their hair, chapped, freckled and scorched their skin, put on weight, all to literally get into the skin of their characters and made themselves look (conventionally) less attractive. The latest addition to them all comes from unexpected quarters. Bollywood, infamous for it&apos;s assembly line that boxes glamor dolls into arm candy roles, observes Isha Koppikhar in a new avatar called Shabri. Inspired by a true story, she sheds her graces to acquire the looks of a slum dweller that evolves into a legendary gangster. \n\nShabri&apos;s story narrates a greater phenomenon in turbulent times, the rise of female criminality. Westernization and industrialization have driven the traditional woman from the domestic space to the productive job sector, (as Shabri runs a flour mill). Added responsibilities, stress and failure to attain their socially defined goals drive frustration and pave the ways of their families into crime. The entry of Shabri represents and strikingly resonates with this rising demographic. She rises from the ashes of poverty forced by survival to climb into the snake pit of political power in the Mumbai underworld.\n\nThe meticulous eyes of Lalit Marathe cover every clinical aspect, be it the sewed shreds on her blouse, or her brother stealing her slippers because his own pair is torn and they can&apos;t afford new ones. The camera shots and angles are absolutely novel and brilliant. They show the characters in poignant frames and settings, putting together nothing less than a work of art. Simple objects like a dead tree branch, a window or a balcony are used as props and benchmarks to express the moods of the characters. Feels like the arrival of Louvre in the Mumbai underworld. \n\nThroughout the film, Shabri&apos;s presence is more powerful than words, her silence more deafening than screams. As she rests her head on a brick wall while mourning the loss of a loved one, and as her tearful eyes look up in a slant to her captor that takes her home, grief gives way to fury. The supporting cast plays their part just right, with the finesse and the pace that fits the mood of the film. The villain&apos;s character is especially well developed, as he depicts a variety of emotions, not just negative tones, leading him to become one more of the characters in the film rather than just a bad guy. Shabri&apos;s relationship with Murad is very well distanced, as well as crafted. Their platonic coexistence has romantic roots, but ones that remain unspoken of. There are many tender moments in the film where bringing closure to the scene would set the film on the path of a commercial potboiler. However as a maestro would, the director holds back, allowing the viewer&apos;s imagination to execute the task. \n\nA fascinating character in the film is Inspector Quazi. Various psychology theories suggest that one of the deepest roots to human motivation is that of seeking stimulation, and Quazi fits it perfectly. A man of outstanding capabilities who is bored with the mundane routine of his job, he strives to reinvent his job such that he may be amused and entertained. He lives his life with the pursuit of unleashing chaos, aspiring to keep the reins of all the players of the game in his own hands. What sets this movie a class apart is that the brutality and action is not driven to over kill. It makes a gritty as well as a crisp viewing experience. There isn&apos;t an abundance or overflow of blood, nor any loudness in the expressions of those in it. Fights are swift and real, not orchestrated, nor elaborate. The colors are faded and blood is dark red, not vermilion. Gunshots are snappy, and deaths of important characters devoid of melodrama. From the waters lapping against the shore at low tide at the docks, to the hand rubbed polish on Rawat&apos;s vintage Jaguar, Shabri is a vividly constructed original script as well as a well narrated tale. Unlike many others, it does not end where the audience starts to leave the theater. It ties up the loose ends, relates to how life proceeds for each of the significant characters, and how the dark night gives way to dawn. The aftertaste it leaves behind is not necessarily sweet, but one that perfectly whets the viewers&apos; appetite.\n\nThe action role in a Saree also makes Shabri a cultural icon. Since gender equality and feminist themes in media originated in western nations, most action roles enacted by women in Bollywood have been in western attires (with the added flexibility in physical movement). But unlike the many who dress as Lara Croft to depict an action performance, Shabri kicks, shoots, jumps, and runs in a tattered Saree. Being the first female actor that embraces her action role with an Indian identity, she doesn&apos;t imitate a fighting man. She&apos;s a woman that fights as herself. \n\nWith this performance, Isha Koppikhar challenges the corridors of power in Bollywood just as the fictitious Shabri does to her male counterparts. In a land where men pursue fair and handsome and women&apos;s dowry rates correlate with the sales of fair and lovely creams, she displays the courage to add more layers of darkness to her complexion. She could evoke mourning for the demise of porcelain beauty, or celebrations for the arrival of character and essence in a woman. But her charms invade our senses as the touch of raindrops on a heated brick wall. Unnerving, yet soothing and memorable."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Crime"",""Drama""]","""2011-08-26""","""gangster,feminist,bollywood,underworld,mob""","""1H38M""",11.0

The film looked like made on the identical plot of Rahul meeting a completely stranger girl one fine day and they spending few hours together with her as a new experience of his life.\n\nPerhaps Rahul may also have realized the resemblance in the story plot himself while reading the script. But still for reasons unknown he said yes to it and therefore, here he is once again meeting an unknown attractive married woman, who has just decided to be herself for one whole day forgetting all about her husband and children. (For the records he earlier met a prostitute one night in CHAMELI and later had met a South Indian Brahmin married women travelling with her child in a bus in MR &amp; MRS IYER.)\n\nBut contrary to all my minimal expectations, the film turned out to be pretty bad, which doesn&apos;t even deserve to be compared with the gem called MR &amp; MRS IYER. In fact it&apos;s even far inferior than the dud CHAMELI too and can be simply included in the list of worst movies released this year. With a reputed off-beat cinema favourite, Rahul Bose paired against the competent Shifaali, KUCCH LUV JAISA could have been at least a fairly enjoyable ride for the audience. But unfortunately the film becomes quite bore and uninteresting right from the moment the two actors meet each other on the screen.\n\nIn other words, after the few initial good scenes indicating towards the &apos;Seven Year Itch&apos; in the family, the script looks like completely outdated and un-happening in the literal sense. It is neither an entertaining thriller moving with a fast pace nor an enlightening one making you aware of your inner being. It neither gives you any enjoyable performance to compensate for its boring content (Rahul &amp; Shifaali), nor does it offer any soothing music or songs to cool you off (Pritam). The director Barnali Ray Shukla has made the film as if it was a School Project of a student to be essentially completed and presented in front of the teacher in the given time frame.\n\nHence after watching it, I had only one thought in my mind that what could have been the purpose of making this film in such an irresponsible manner. There is so much effort, pain and hard work needed from so many people to make a project reach the screen, then why such kind of Sure Flop film was planned by the production house so confidently. But then suddenly I remembered the name of its producer Vipul Shah, (also husband of Shifaali) who has earlier produced huge hits such as SINGH IS KINNG, NAMASTE London and more. \n\nSo as a conclusion, either this film was made to satisfy the inner urge of Shifaali or it was made to show some extra expenses or losses in the account books as per the normal business procedure of a Big Production house. In any case the victim once again remains the poor viewer."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama""]","""2011-05-27""","""love""","""1H45M""",11.0

Moreover its really surprising to see the film made on an ages old concept of separated twin brothers (not resembling each other), inspired from the English flick TWINS (1988) which was also seen in HUMSE BADHKAR KAUN released in 1998.\n\nThe amateurish writing rarely offers any good funny scenes in this 113 minutes film and the songs too range from poor to average including the most publicized &quot;Birju&quot; featuring cameos of Amitabh Bachchan, Hrithik Roshan, Ajay Devgn, Akshay Kumar, Ranveer Singh and Prabhu Deva. Adding to the uninteresting proceedings even Govinda (in a scene) and Mahie Gill (in an item song) fail to deliver anything engaging along with the other key performers playing their respective characters.\n\nIn short this seems to be made with a vision still hanging somewhere in the 90s that doesn&apos;t work at all despite the help offered by many big names of the industry so generously."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Comedy"",""Drama""]","""2015-03-06""","""brother""","""1H53M""",7.0

Actually it&apos;s much better than one would imagine. It&apos;s not a scene-by-scene copy but rather takes major plot elements, which is not that bad. The film tells the story of Shankar, who spent years in prison since childhood for having killed his uncle, who tried to sell Shankar&apos;s mother for alcohol. Once released, he attempts to get his life the right path, but never gets the right opportunity, and given his poverty and his mother&apos;s state, gives up and becomes the right hand of an underworld don.\n\nMujrim is a mainstream Hindi film in many ways, but it is very well adapted into its Indian setting. The film explores issues of poverty, crime, religion and faith, and it does so rather effectively through the character of Shankar, his headstrong and devoted mother, and his transition from the slums to becoming the head of the organisation where he started merely as an assistant. Some of the scenes are quite tough viewing, and as the film proceeds, we see our hero trapped in his own web of crime and misdemeanors.\n\nThe is stereotypical in many ways, but it also emphasises values of friendship, respect for elders, loyalty, provides commentary on social stigma and shows the destructive repercussions of the world of crime. Its romantic portions are quite good. The characters are quite well written, particularly that of Yashoda, who never wavers from her faith and the strength of her convictions. Anu Malik&apos;s music is very good. The title track is quite sad and very situationally relevant within the film as it comes after the film&apos;s most harrowing pictures of poverty. &quot;Naiyo Jeena Tere Bina&quot; is beautiful both melodically and visually.\n\nMithun Chakraborty, one of India&apos;s most talented and prolific actors, does a fantastic job as Shankar. His performance is both moving and believable. Madhuri Dixit, as his young leading lady, is gorgeous and absolutely charming. Her transformation throughout the film is done really well. Shakti Kapoor gets a serious role for once and does it well, the same is true of Sharat Saxena who is excellent as Sonia&apos;s father and Shankar&apos;s kind boss. Amrish Puri is brilliant as the main villain. Pallavi Joshi as Shankar&apos;s sister is very good, and Suresh Oberoi is okay as the police officer.\n\nThe most brilliant performance in the film is undoubtedly and unsurprisingly that of Nutan. As Yashoda, she is unaffected by the film&apos;s faults and comes across as a very real woman with her realistic acting and natural presence. Her character&apos;s perseverance and steadfast determination to keep her faith and never lose her moral integrity is never hard to believe. Due credit goes to her - Nutan shines in this film, creating the perfect epitome of Indian simplicity and honesty. Her expressions are as always highly impressive. This is one of the last performances of one of the greatest actresses to have graced the Indian screen.\n\nMujrim is a good film, much better than expected, and great entertainment all in all. The ending is excellent, and it&apos;s quite sad that some good films never gained notice mainly because they were released at a time when most other products were not up to the mark. This one is worth a watch, not for everyone, but fans of Mithun Chakraborty and his many films during the time should definitely give it a try."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Crime""]","""1989-06-28""","""gangster,mother son relationship,anti hero,love,well""", ,33.0

The treatment may look a bit plain, few loopholes appear in the story, and goes for a bit of glibness in the end. Despite this, the film has succeeded to bring an important social issue into the light and even shown a right alternative.

But it&apos;s the bravura performance of the film&apos;s leading lady, Kajol that saves the film from going into slumps. Kajol was flying high these days with the success of Baazigar and UKZ further solidifies her position in Bollywood as a heroine of substance.\n\nKajol is wonderful from the very first frame of the movie. The film is basically about a granddaughter&apos;s (Kajol) constant struggles to placate her angry grandfather played by Jeetendra. The reason that Jeetendra is angry at Kajol is because his son married a girl whom he didn&apos;t approve of. Kajol&apos;s father then walks out on Jeetendra and settles down in USA. Years later, Kajol comes back to India but with a secret whom she&apos;s dead scared to disclose to anyone, including her doting grandmother played by Moushumi Chatterjee.\n\nAs mentioned above, Kajol is magnificent in this movie. The sincerity with which she portrays her character shows off in many scenes. Her character Sita&apos;s expression of frustration, sadness, happiness and vanity is well conveyed by Kajol. Jeetendra and Moushumi Chatterjee&apos;s chemistry is excellent and the couple look too good on screen. Moushumi Chatterjee portrays her character with grace and a certain amount of vulnerability. Ravi Kishen as Jeetendra&apos;s son was good. Rohit Bhatia as the leading lady&apos;s love interest is strictly okay. Given the fact that it&apos;s a heroine-driven film, the hero had nothing worth mentioning to do.\n\nThe music of UKZ is heartwarming, especially &quot;thodi haasi thode ansoo&quot;.

Its basically a sports film revolving around KABADDI, a lesser explored Indian sport on the silver screen, that now gains some substantial ground in the media due to many recent big events and competitions involving the big stars. Perhaps we desperately need these stars only to promote anything in our country pointing towards a questionable blind following seen in the present times.\n\nAnyway, talking about the star-less BADLAPUR BOYS focusing on our traditional sport hugely famous in the rural regions, I wish it was a more quality affair supported by the big names. Since the film is in fact a well intentioned attempt to present KABADDI in a more entertaining and educative manner before the audience explaining its basic rules too quite interestingly. But on the other hand, an uninspiring execution, all amateur new faces, their mediocre acting and the avoidable insertion of an elaborate romantic angle ruins the novel subject after a fine start and we get to see a lesser engaging film than expected with only few good scenes related with the exciting sport towards the end. \n\nIn reality, a sports film always has a disadvantage of being a predictable fare and thus needs to be written with some surprisingly novel sub-plots to keep the viewers glued to the narration as an essential feature. Now where BADLAPUR BOYS does come up with an interesting story-base revolving around a team of underdogs with an unexpected twist, it sadly fails to execute it well focusing on a single character and delivers only few engaging moments in its final 30 minutes when the team is playing the State tournament.\n\nAll the new faces try their best to put up a good show along with Anu Kapoor trying hard to impress as their honest coach giving the film its much required support. The cinematography really captures the game movements well but the background music remains uneven scoring mostly in the second hour. Musically the film has a well made title song (catching your attention right away) and few average romantic tracks too with an old-school picturisation featuring many back-up dancers in traditional dresses. But the writing remains the biggest flaw of BADLAPUR BOYS with many clichéd sequences, comical villains, not so impressive dialogues and an unconvincing (or rather illogical) tragic end unable to move the viewers emotionally.\n\nIn all, one cannot just ridicule the film due to the tacky making as it does remain one of the few movies enlightening the viewers about our traditional sport in a fine manner. Hence I would simply like to call it a pretty weak but well intentioned attempt to make an Indian sport film on Kabaddi, which could have been much better."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama""]","""2014-12-12""","""play""","""2H3M""",8.0

And if you are even remotely aware of the completely biased and questionable buying/exhibition system of our industry then you would certainly agree that this is not a small or ignorable feat from any angle at all.\n\nHowever the same cannot be said about the movie as such, since it unfortunately falters badly on the execution level offering nothing in terms of quality entertainment even if we take into account the typical Bollywood elements of a single screen market. Beginning with a story telling style straight away reminding you of the recent GUNDAY, it suddenly gives you a weird sequence where in a 12 years old boy falls in love with a 22-23 years old girl and then later marries the same girl when he grows up to be the leading hero of the film as if the girl had stopped aging in the gap period.\n\nEverything routine keeps happening on the screen with many loud and hamming acts which fall flat despite the presence of veterans such as Ashutosh Rana and Suniel Shetty. Plus the love angles simply do not work in both the pre or post interval portions and the Police officials are pathetically portrayed as mere puppets of the politicians quite brutally. Perhaps our censors find &quot;Kissing and Sex scenes&quot; more offensive than this sick and shameful depiction of our Police force on screen following their own set of strange guidelines. Anyhow where the first half can still be called bearable, the second becomes more absurd with every passing sequence and one feels pretty bad thinking about the potential plot of taking the underworld sharp shooters to the international shooting competitions exploiting their hidden talent in a much better manner turning them into a different person.\n\nFew surprisingly above average songs, apt cinematography and background score try their best to lift up the film repeatedly but the blame has to be given to the captain of the ship for the big messy second hour without any arguments. Moreover in the acting department too we do not get anything great to enjoy except the few scenes of Ashutosh Rana alone. Jai Bhanushali and the debutant Akhil Kapur still have to go a long way in terms of acting and Sasha Agha really needs to stay away from hamming in her future acts. Tia Bajpai as the other leading lady gets nothing to do in the film and Suniel Shetty once again plays an all seen before kind of role trying to save the project with his sincere efforts in vain.\n\nIn short with every required element of film-making at his disposal, Anand Kumar once again presents a clumsy film based on a well chosen plot which could have resulted in a much better product if conceived with a different vision."",""reviewRating""","[""Action""]","""2014-09-12""","""friend""","""2H19M""",8.0

After Aman is humiliated by Bahadur, Shabnam and Aman elope and travel to Luckno..."",""","""If you are a young man (even when you are not so young) and in a rainy night, you happen to see an extremely beautiful girl in a drenched condition, what will be the reaction on you ? Quite naturally, you will get romantic. And if you are an eligible bachelor, you may experience a storm in your heart which is sure to be much bigger than the storm being faced by you in the outer world that night.\n\nBarsaat Ki Raat (rainy night) is the story based upon such a rainy night only in which the hero, Bharat Bhooshan happens to see the heroine, Madhubala in a drenched state with her dress sticking to her body. Madhubala was so beautiful that she used to be referred to as the Venus of the Indian screen. Well, such an extra-ordinary beauty and that too in the drenched state in the rainy night, needless to say that heavens fell for the heart of our young hero. \n\nThe story starts from this rainy stormy night of Hyderabad (coincidentally I am also at Hyderabad and it&apos;s raining too) and moves to Lucknow. The hero, Aman is a Qawwaal as well as a Shaayar (Urdu poet) and as was natural in that time; young, charming and emotional ladies used to fall for the touching poetry. So that sudden meeting under a shed in that rainy night changed the life of both the young Shaayar, Aman and the charming damsel, Shabnam who is the daughter of the police commissioner (K.N. Singh). The hiatus in the statuses becomes the insurmountable wall between the love-birds. Aman moves to Lucknow and keeps on participating in the Mushaayaras (gatherings of Urdu poets with the recitation of Urdu poetry). A lady Qawwaal, Shama (Shyama) has already fallen for him. So there&apos;s a love-triangle in the story. Finally, the story heads to Ajmer Shareef for its climax in which Aman defeats a renowned Qawwaal in a Qawwaali contest (Muqaabala-E-Qawwaali) and gets his sweetheart.\n\nThis movie is based on the unique genre of music and poetry, Qawwaali which is not an easy one to perform for even the seasoned and expert singers. In this movie, the hero is not only an Urdu poet and singer, he is portrayed as an expert in creating extempore poetry for his Qawwaalis while the contest or the Muqaabla is in progress. The lyricist of this movies&apos; songs, the great Shaayar Sahir Ludhiyanvi and the music director, Roshan both have done an outstanding job in creating memorable Qawwaalis (and normal songs too) for the story of the movie. Seasoned singers like Manna Dey, Rafi, Batish, Shankar-Shambhu, Balbir, Lata, Asha, Suman Kalyanpur, Sudha Malhotra, Kamal Barot have given their voices for the Qawwaalis and the songs. In fact, it&apos;s the extra-ordinary music of this movie which has made it immortal.\n\nAll the songs are real gems. It boasts of classic Qawwaalis like Na To Kaarvaan Ki Talash Hai (which includes Ye Ishq Ishq Hai Ishq Ishq), Jee Chaahta Hai Choom Loon, Nigaah-E-Naaz Ke Maaron Ka Haal Kya Hoga etc. In addition to them, memorable songs like - Zindagi Bhar Nahin Bhoolegi Woh Barsaat Ki Raat, Garjat Barsat Saawan Aayo Re, Maine Shaayad Tumhen Pehle Bhi Kahin Dekha Hai, Mujhe Mil Gaya Bahaana Teri Deed Ka, Maayus To Hoon Vaade Se Tere etc. are all a grand treat for the genuine music lovers. Listening to these songs take the music-lover to a different enchanting world, where he / she loses the sense of the outer world and just lost in the in the melody and the Shaayari drenched with sentiments.\n\nThe movie is otherwise also very interesting. Director P.L. Santoshi has ably directed this unusual story. Curiosity has been maintained well for the viewer. Art direction and cinematography are A class. The Muslim environment in the cities of Hyderabad, Lucknow and Ajmer in the fifties has been exasperated in an admirable manner. Production value is high. Editing is also good.\n\nPerformances are quite good. Bharat Bhoosan was a specialist in the roles of artists (Shaayar, poet, singer, painter etc.) and he has done well in this movie too. The Indian Venus, Madhubala is a treat to watch. She has performed well too. K.N. Singh as the stern police commissioner, Shyama as Shama, Ratna (playing her younger sister, Shabaab) and all others have supported the main cast quite proficiently. Ratna&apos;s performances as Shabaab deserves special mention.\n\nThis black and white movie is an evergreen classic and the only movie based on timeless Qawwaalis. Such movies are hard to find in today&apos;s times. So watch it and get nostalgic once again."",""reviewRating""", , , ,"""2H22M""",62.0

The lady in the title role is already dead in the story but she, through her memories, the references to her in people&apos;s talks and her belongings left behind, continues to haunt the life of the new wife of her husband. It&apos;s a great psychological mystery whose climax was changed in the movie by the director, Alfred Hitchcock to suit the mentality of the American audience those days.\n\nThe great singer-musician of Indian cinema, Hemant Kumar adapted this story for a Hindi movie - Kohra (mist) in 1964, taking Biswajeet in the male lead, i.e., as the dead woman&apos;s husband and Waheeda Rehman in the central role of the hero&apos;s wife. Interestingly, despite the story revolving around the memories of the dead lady (called Poonam in the movie), the director has not shown her face despite several flash backs. He has allowed the audience to see either her body starting from the neck (in the front pose) or see herself from the back side. And that&apos;s the reason, I don&apos;t know which actress played this character who is the soul of the story.\n\nIn this Indianized version of Rebecca, widower Raja Amit Kumar Singh (Biswajeet) marries Rajeshwari (Waheeda Rehman) who enters his mansion with a lot of hope for her joyful future only to be stunned by the high-handed attitude of Daai Maa (Lalita Pawar) who looks upon her derogatorily and always compares her with Poonam, the deceased wife of her husband. By misguiding her to wear the attires of Poonam and imitating her mannerisms, Daai Maa brings about a rift in her relationship with her husband too. But one fine morning, the dead body of Poonam is found and Raja Amit Kumar Singh is arrested under the charge of her murder. Gradually the inner secrets of Poonam&apos;s life come to the fore. The ultimate truth is revealed in the climax taking place in the court-room.\n\nDirector Biren Naag has quite skilfully adapted the classic story of Rebecca for this Indianized story and changed the climax once again (firstly it was changed by Alfred Hitchcock in the Hollywood movie - Rebecca) which suits the taste of the Indian audience. The drama takes some time to pick-up but it is quite speedy in the later part and keeps the audience spellbound.\n\nGorgeous and talented Waheeda Rehman is the main attraction of this black and white movie. She impresses in all kinds of scenes - romantic, emotional and painful. Biswajeet is okay in the male lead. The supporting cast has done its part well. However the best performer is definitely Lalita Pawar in the role of Daai Maa (a role akin to the role of Mrs. Danvers in Rebecca). It is definitely one of her best performances. I will be highly grateful if somebody can tell me the name of the actress who played the role of Poonam (or Rebecca if we refer to the original story) because her face is never revealed in the movie.\n\nMusic is, in fact, the biggest strength of this classic suspense-thriller. Producer of this movie, Hemant Kumar has composed as well as sung the songs which include gems like - Ye Nayan Dare Dare and Raah Bani Khud Manzil. The movie contains Lata&apos;s classic songs like - Jhoom Jhoom Dhalti Raat and O Beqaraar Dil as well. Asha-Mahendra Kapoor duet - Kaahe Bajaai Tune is also in this movie. The beautiful lyrics have been dropped by the pen of Kaifi Aazmi.\n\nCinematography, art-direction, editing and production value aspects of this black and white movie are all up to the mark. The movie proves to be a memorable experience for the viewer after it is over.\n\nThose who have not read (or seen) Rebecca, should not miss this classic Bollywood mystery. However, those who have read the novel or seen the Hollywood movie, will also find it quite engrossing and entertaining. And it&apos;s a very big treat for the fans of Waheeda."",""reviewRating""", , , ,"""2H33M""",58.0

And this underrated movie is another illustration of his abundant talent. It&apos;s a brilliant movie whose class can be felt and understood by seeing it only.\n\nThough several Bollywood movies have come before the audience which are based on encounter-specialists and several others have come which are based on the corrupt cops. However this movie is unique. It&apos;s neither Gangaajal nor Apharan, nor Ab Tak Chhappan nor Kagaar nor Ye Saali Zindagi. It has a class of its own. Encounter specialist cop, Nana Patekar is thoroughly corrupt and works for the corrupt politician, Zaakir Hussain, eliminating his adversaries and those who can prove dangerous for him. He gets a newly recruited junior cop, Mohit Ahlawat to work under him in the police station. The real drama starts with the kidnapping of some journalists consisting of Mohit&apos;s sweetheart, Rimi Sen too. Some hardcore terrorists are released for getting the journalists free and alongwith them is released the ex-henchman of Zaakir Hussain, Anuraag Kashyap. How the main protagonist Nana Patekar and his Shagird (pupil), Mohit Ahlawat get involved in these developments and what&apos;s the climax of this story is a treat to watch.\n\nShagird is a rare thriller made in Bollywood which keeps the viewer spellbound right from the very first frame to the very last frame. There is no unnecessary dragging and no useless incidents to add to the length of the movie. Even the smallest incident shown in the movie has a link with the main story. It&apos;s something unusually pleasant and evidences the proficiency of the script-writer and the director. The narrative keeps the viewer hooked throughout 140 minutes long duration. The first half prepares the ground for the second half and the second half keeps on rendering electric currents to the viewer, scene after scene. There is a twist in the tale even in the ending scene. The superfast pace of the movie does not give the viewer any time to think. But it does not challenge his intelligence and after watching the movie completely, if the viewer ponders over what he has seen, he does not feel cheated because everything is logically knitted and in proper place. Even the title of the movie is just perfect according to the story told. The second half of the movie is just like a game of chess, containing checks and checkmates upon the chessboard of the Indian police system. It reminds of Abbas-Mustan&apos;s movie - Race in which it becomes difficult for the viewer to identify as to who colludes with whom and who deceives whom.\n\nThough the kidnapping episode is not very impressive and the Mohit Ahlawat-Rimi Sen romance track is half-baked, these are minor flaws in this otherwise highly admirable movie. The director has shown his better sense by keeping the movie sans any songs and the flow of the narrative is nowhere blocked. The background score and the technical aspects of the movie are topnotch. The action and chase sequences are outstanding. The cinematographer has captured Delhi and nearby areas quite realistically and impressively.\n\nI also admire the director for keeping the movie free from expletives which is also unusual now-a-days. Given the milieu of the story, he could have filled it with expletives under the pretext of showing reality. But it&apos;s very nice of him to keep the movie clean. He has not shown any vulgarity also.\n\nNana Patekar has outshined his co-actors in the author-backed role of the smart, yet corrupt cop who is very fond of old Hindi movie songs and whose knowledge about them is extra-ordinary (like the author of this review). His role reminds me of the main protagonist of a Hindi pulp-fiction bestsellter - Vardi Waala Gunda (penned by Ved Prakash Sharma). However I feel that he is now typecast in such roles. Mohit Ahlawat has wasted a golden opportunity and he is just average. Anuraag Kashyap has proved that he is not only a class director, but also a class actor. Rimi Sen and others are OK. Murli Sharma leaves his mark in the cameo of a coward journalist. But the distinction marks go to Zaakir Hussain who has infused life into the role of the corrupt politician.\n\nTigmanshu Dhulia has taken cinematic liberty of ignoring several aspects of the Indian police system in telling his story but he can be excused for that because keeping the narration focused at the desired place instead of covering several diversified things on a large canvas, has helped keeping the movie engrossing and entertaining.

Kyoon ? Aur Kahaan ? (1970) is a suspense-thriller as suggested by the title (When ? Why ? And Where ?) which stars Dharmendra and Babita in lead roles with Pran playing the villain of the story. It is an entertaining movie and worth a watch by all standards. The producer-director of this movie - Arjun Hingorani had a strange fancy regarding the titles of the movies made by him. He always used three &apos;K&apos;s in the title concerned. Hence the title here also contains three &apos;K&apos;s, considering the mystery-filled plot, the title is apt though.\n\nThe movie opens with the killing of a rich man (Murad) in an accident staged by his adversaries. Then starts the world tour of Asha (Babita), the daughter of the victim. She happens to come across Anand (Dharmendra) during her sea-journey and they fall in love (quite naturally). When she is back home, attempts start on her life too. Apparently, it&apos;s her greedy uncle (Pran) only who is masterminding everything because he wants to usurp all the wealth of hers by eliminating her. Being unaware of her uncle&apos;s evil designs but quite aware of his licentious nature, Asha happens to kill him one night when he tries to molest her close friend Lata (Ashoo). On one hand, Anand is investigating the death of her father in his capacity of a C.I.D. officer, on the other she herself becomes a murderess who now has to get rid of the dead body of her uncle in her bid to escape the law. After many interesting incidents and twists in the story, the mystery gets unravelled.\n\nKab ? Kyoon ? Aur Kahaan is a movie which contains the romantic encounter of the lead pair in the initial reels but soon gets on its crime and suspense-filled track. The main twist in the story arrives at the interval point and the narrative in the post interval session is so fast that it never loosens its grip on the spectator at any point of time. The result is - the spectator keeps on watching holding his breath and making guesses about the mystery and the further development of the story. The movie has been written as well as directed very well.\n\nThere are ample doses of romance blended with comedy in the movie but finally, it&apos;s the suspense aspect that takes it over. Firstly, it appears to be a flat crime-thriller with a well-identified villain (Pran) and his well-identified villainous activities. However gradually the story advances in such a way that an aura of mystery prevails on the screen and consequentially on the minds of the viewers. The movie does not bore at any place and it has been made by using all the regular Bollywood formulae whose mix appears to be almost right. There may be viewers who are able to guess the solution of the mystery correctly. They are bound to feel entertained by this flick all the same.\n\nPerformances are admirable. Dashing hero Dharmendra, gorgeous heroine Babita (I always find her much prettier than her daughters who are high profile heroines of today) and the stylish evergreen villain Pran are all very impressive in their respective roles. Pran&apos;s unique style of smoking (leaving rings of smoke from his mouth) was something that nobody could imitate. His performance in the final part of the movie is simply awesome. Debutante Ashoo as the heroine&apos;s buddy, Helen as the villain&apos;s accomplice, Shetty as a rowdy on the ship, Hiralaal as a mysterious lunatic etc. are well in place. Asit Sen and Dhuman have done good comedy.\n\nKalyanji-Anandji&apos;s music is not great but not bad either. The title track (Ho Gaye Tere Ho Gaye) is the best from the album. The music directors themselves alongwith the hero (Dharmendra) are the presenters of this movie.\n\nTechnically this colour movie is up to the mark. The sequences involving the ship, the sea and the natural beauty are quite impressive. This mystery is a little bit scary too. Action and thrills are good. Length of the movie is also optimum.\n\nAll in all, Kab ? Kyoon ? Aur Kahaan ? is an interesting suspense movie which the mystery fans can enjoy like anything. Courtesy the heart-tickling romance, the audience of romantic movies is also sure to like it."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Mystery"",""Romance""]","""1970-05-08""","""disposing of a dead body,nervous breakdown,heiress,ghost,paranoia""","""2H16M""",52.0

Not saying that every flop film of Bhatt&apos;s is bad, but this one maybe deserved it. Bhatt made some real neat films in the these days, and I salute the director for his dedication to the industry. Maybe for money or for passion? He use to work five or may six films at one time (most of the time his assitants would cover for him) Who knows why he made so many. Back to the film, Naaraaz happens to be Mahesh&apos;s weakest during the 90&apos;s. Why did I watch the film? The film happens to include one of my favourite songs of all time, so I felt I will give it a try for the song.\n\nWhy does the film fail? The film is rehash or remake of his earlier hit Naam, where two brothers/friends are separated in different countries due to circumstances and one begins to make is life from crime as he feels low in his own eyes. Only difference here is that one is rich and the other poor while in Naam it was two brothers from the same household.\n\nThe title itself shows the character of Deva who is angry with the world altogether, angry because he never got an education or even angry at his poverty, hence he wants to make his own life. The script could have been much a better considering the cast and the visuals, because they both are fantastic. The film has been made very well and directed well too, some of the scenes you can tell the producers have spent well money on.

He travels to Coorg where his family used to own a coffee farm; the unsolicited and unofficial sale of which marks the beginning of his family&apos;s immortal poverty. Dev was the one who had sold the property without consulting with his parents, which had instantly led to his father&apos;s death and also eventually his mother&apos;s, so his visit to Coorg is to make peace with his past by doing one good and sane thing for his family and to peacefully say a final goodbye to his mother.\n\nThe story is written with a deadpan attitude, but that is what the protagonist is all about. He believes in spirituality but hasn&apos;t been able to fix his own strings, and regards other people as garbage. He thinks that going back to the place where he spent his childhood days might alleviate his agony, but the problem mounts when he meets Anika there with her husband (Kapoor)? Successfully setting a suspense tone, the screenplay moves forward slowly crescendoing into a moment of cinematic resuscitation.\n\nCast performance is good, but the film&apos;s technical parameters reduces its value. For instance, the sound mixing is horrible, which points to the fact that writing and acting aren&apos;t the only parameters which mark a film&apos;s creativity and/or novelty. Plus, the music seems plagiarized, with the final theme sounding like a Hollywood ballad.\n\nAll said and done, the story is true to the heart and conveys a message about emotional baggage that can only be dumped through service/altruism.

In retaliation he is framed, his wife Radha (Kamini Kaushal) loses her mental balance, and his teenaged son Arjun is forced to fend for himself on the streets until he grows up and becomes the local vigilante No. 10 (Manoj Kumar). Bade Maalik gets Karamchand&apos;s wife, Sundari (Hema Malini) who had overheard the conversation, killed on route to Pune, but the kind-hearted jobber leaves the girl with a lame alcoholic who grows up to be a street hustler, Rosemary Fernandes (also played by Hema Malini) who after a few hiccups flips for No. 10.\n\nInto the narrative enters CBI officer Karam - also doubling up as corrupt Havaldar Karan Singh Badshah (Pran) who clandestinely helps Arjun nab the fake currency racketeers - who is none other than loud and reckless Inspector Jaichand (Prem Nath), who too supposedly has a double, the real brain behind the racket. Pran excels, masquerading through several get-ups, improvising dialogue in the process. Hema is brilliant. Bindu just has two dance numbers and a scene in which she excels.\n\nAlthough he tries his best, his familiar mannerism, modulated dialogue delivery and soft hero image make Manoj Kumar a weak gangster.\n\nThe comedy sequences are crude.

As per Ovid&apos;s narrative poem - Metamorphoses, Pygmalion was a sculptor who fell in love with the idol of a woman he had carved out of ivory. Taking an inspiration from the character of that sculptor, renowned playwright George Bernard Shaw wrote a play titled as Pygmalion in 1912 which was a sarcastic commentary on the British society and culture as prevailing in that period. In that play, Professor Henry Higgins enters into a bet with a friend of his that he can turn a bedraggled girl from the lower strata of the society into such a well-cultured girl wearing a veneer of gentility that she will pass for a duchess at a party hosted by an ambassador. And he actually succeeds in doing so by turning a flower girl - Eliza Doolittle into a well-mannered lady who by all means appears to belong to aristocracy and therefore acceptable in the so-called high society and thus wins the bet. But this girl is a flesh and blood human-being and not a lifeless idol as made by Pygmalion. She has a heart filled with womanly feelings. Can she be discarded now and thrown back to the class that she was initially picked from ? \n\nInspired by this play, a movie was made in Hollywood. This movie is My Fair Lady (1964) starring Rex Harrison in the role of Professor Henry Higgins and Audrey Hepburn in the role of Eliza Doolittle. This highly acclaimed movie won 8 Oscar awards and many other different awards. Producer Amit Khanna and director Basu Chatterjee made the Indianized version of this story taking Dev Anand and Tina Munim in lead roles. This Hindi movie is Manpasand (1980).\n\nManpasand (favourite / pet) is the story of two Mumbai (then Bombay) based close friends who are bachelors and active in the line of music - Prataap (Dev Anand) and Kaashinaath (Girish Karnaad). Prataap happens to enter into a bet with Kaashinaath that he can turn a poor, uneducated and uncultured girl into a polished and graceful one as well as a skilled singer within just a timespan of six months. Kaashinaath agrees under the same bet that if Prataap is able to do so, he will marry that girl unconditionally and without any hitch. Prataap picks up a girl Kamli (Tina Munim) for this purpose whom he happens to come across in a local train when he finds her selling Datoons (indigenous tooth-brushes made of margosa branches). Kamli&apos;s good-for-nothing father (Mehmood) is kept at bay by these two gentlemen by paying money to him and Kamli is brought to Prataap&apos;s home. Now both the friends become Kamli&apos;s teachers. Prataap is acerbic and authoritarian in his approach whereas Kaashinaath is soft-spoken and gentle in his dealings with her. She learns classical music (covering singing and playing lute) from Prataap. From Kaashinaath, she learns etiquette, correct way of talking and cultured behaviour.\n\nThe day comes when Kamli performs before a large audience and wins lots of accolades. From every angle, now she looks an elite lady and nobody present in the event is able to make even the wildest guess as to what she has been originally. Quite naturally, Prataap has won the bet against Kaashinaath and Kaashinaath too, being very happy at the development, is having no issues regarding marrying Kamli. However in the euphoria of their success, they completely forget the hard work and toil invested by Kamli in her transformation. Prataap disregards Kamli&apos;s feelings also. A disheartened Kamli leaves his house and moves out of his life. Later Kaashinaath feels that Prataap has unknowingly fallen in love with Kamli. He releases Prataap from the bet and asks him to accept Kamli and her sentiments for him. However Kamli has already left. The story concludes on a happy note.\n\nDoing justice to great plots is no easy thing. It demands a lot of effort, care and patience. Plus casting is also a significant factor. For great stories, the casting should be done after investing a lot of thought, else the result can be a disaster. The maker and the director of Manpasand seem to have faltered in this regard. This movie is not a disaster or a crap. It does not live up to the expectation or come anywhere near to My Fair Lady all the same.\n\nThe script-writer could not prepare a very interesting script. In the ending reels, the movie becomes heavy with sentiments. However the seasoned director Basu Chatterjee has not allowed the movie to go too much awry.\n\nMusic director Rajesh Roshan has prepared average compositions for most of the songs. Two songs are Indianized versions of the English songs composed by Frederick Loewe viz. Hothon Pe Geet Jaage is based on the tune of &apos;I could have danced all night&apos; and Rehni Ko Ek Ghar Hoga is based on the tune of &apos;Wouln&apos;t it be loverly&apos;. Other than these songs, Charu Chandra Ki Chanchal Chitvan only appears okay, Kishore Kumar&apos;s song - Manmaani Se Hargiz Na Daro is humorous though. Rest all the songs are passable. Amit Khanna&apos;s lyrics are good.\n\nDev Anand and Tina Munim are completely miscast in the lead roles. The faulty casting is one of the reasons which has let this movie down. Only the renowned Indian author, playwright, actor and theatre personality - Girish Karnaad has done full justice to the role of Kaashinaath. Mehmood and others are routine.\n\nAs said earlier, Manpasand is a lost opportunity because a great plot could not be converted into an admirable movie. However since this movie is not a bad movie either, I recommend it to those who like emotion-soaked dramas. Evergreen hero Dev Anand was fading out fast at the time of making of this movie which can be considered as one of his last movies which are worth a mention. Hence his (huge) fan-following also can give it a dekko."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Drama""]","""1980-06-11""","""friend,train,bachelor,singer,etiquette""", ,42.0

From Jagannath&apos;s own son Amar (Mukul Dev), t..."",""","""Acting legend, Dilip Kumar has been bestowed upon with the title of Tragedy King in bollywood (though he had done hilarious comedy too in Ram and Shyam, Gopi etc.). However never had I seen him in a murder mystery and that too with himself doing the investigation of the murder, prior to Qila which is the last released movie of his acting career. Quite interestingly, Dilip Kumar is not only the investigator but also the murdered one as well, doing double role in this movie. In this way, the characters played by Dilip Kumar in his last movie, are quite different from the ones he played throughout his career.\n\nQila was released in April 1998. After appearing in my viva of the Indian Civil Services Exam at the UPSC in the morning hours, I went to watch the matinée show of Qila at Plaza theater in Connaught Place, New Delhi with my wife and my dear friend Aqueel Ahmed on 29th April, 1998. Since the movie was a murder mystery, myself, like always, started guessing about the murderer and discussing with my wife and friend in the interval. However, my guesses did not come true. Somebody else came out as the murderer in the climax and not the one whom I was suspecting to be.\n\nQila starts with a murder committed by Gulshan Grover. However an innocent man is arrested for it and put under trial in the court. The judge, Amar Nath Singh (Dilip Kumar) feels that the convict is innocent but there is nobody to support him. Being a man of justice, he himself decides to investigate the case and find out the truth. However, his task increases when his own twin brother, Jagannath Singh (Dilip Kumar &apos;s second role) is found murdered in his fort (Qila). Jagannath Singh was a corrupt landlord with very low morals and mean mentality because of which Amar Nath Singh had distanced from him. However, he feels that finding out the murderer of his brother is his duty. So he starts digging his past which is full of skeletons. Coming to know of the injustice and wrongdoings of his brother with many people (especially women), judge Amar Nath Singh, along with his murder investigation exercise, takes corrective steps on behalf of his deceased brother to do justice to the victims. However all of them are in his list of murder suspects. The real murderer comes before him in the ending scene only.\n\nQila contains a very good murder plot full of potential. However director Umesh Mehra faltered in developing it into an outstanding murder mystery which he could have done just by exercising some creativity and careful handling of the script. Perhaps he got too overwhelmed with Dilip Kumar&apos;s personality and overlooked certain leads which, if developed properly, could have made this mystery more engrossing and satisfying in the end with revelation of a different character as the murderer.\n\nAll the same, Qila is a good watch since the suspense is well-maintained. The background of the murder and the hidden facts are revealed to the audience on layer-by-layer basis. Dilip Kumar&apos;s briskness and energy at the age of 76 years surprises the viewers. His dance in the song - Kurte ki baiyaan ko upar chadhai ke looks amazing at this age. He is all-pervasive in the movie and gets the maximum possible footage. His towering performance has been ably supported by Mukul Dev who plays the unrecognized son of Jagannath Singh (why the director has named himself too as Amar is not understandable to me as two main characters of the movie having the same name, creates confusion only). The movie contains characters like Rekha, Malay Chakraborty, Mamta Kulkarni, Smita Jaykar etc. However these are all dwarfed before the tall persona of Dilip Kumar. Other than Mukul Dev, if somebody makes her presence felt in the movie, it is Rajeshwari Sachdev who plays the daughter of judge Amar Nath Singh.\n\nThe music given by Anand Raj Anand is quite good. Technical and production value aspects of the movie are more or less OK. The scenes between the brother Mukul Dev and the sister Rajeshwari Sachdev are quite impressive. The director has rendered a logical end to the story after the mystery is resolved.\n\nQila is a good murder mystery which could have been a much better one. However it is an interesting watch. All the mystery fans as well as the fans of Dilip Kumar will like it."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama"",""Family"",""Music""]","""1998-04-10""","""dual role,twin brother,suspect,police inspector,investigation""","""2H13M""",24.0

The plot begins with the murder of an union leader, Acharya which leads to a gang whose members are identified by a gold medal with the gang&apos;s logo. Enter the head of Secret Services, David, ..."",""","""The Gold Medal (1984) is one of those unfortunate movies which take an extra-ordinary time in getting completed (this way or that way) and / or released. Mostly such movies which get completed at a crawling pace or released years later than they were made, render a feeling of staleness to the audience who rejects them outright irrespective of their entertainment value. Sometimes such movies suffer from continuity jerks too (because of dates problem of the principal characters) and that also go against them. \n\nPlease don&apos;t get confused by the title of the movie because the gold medal here does not refer to the gold medal won by anybody in some contest or examination. Here it refers to the identification symbol of the members of a criminal gang. All trusted members of that gang are given gold medals (containing the logo of the gang) by their boss. Our hero could arrange a gold medal for him only in the climax but gets exposed before the gangleader before he could get it and then the action-packed ending scenes take place to bring an end to the story.\n\nThe Gold Medal starts with the killing of an honest, sincere and dedicated trade union leader (Dharmendra) who has been taking on the management of a factory for the cause of the workers. The owner of the factory (K.N. Singh) is not only a greedy and corrupt industrialist but also a traitor who arranges fracases, riots and unrest in Indian for enemy countries as well as corrupt fellows like him and gets handsomely paid for every such misdeed. His criminal gang is involved in smuggling activities too. After masterminding the killing of the union leader, he tries to buy the integrity of the second most significant union leader (Shatrughan Sinha) but fails. However he has many other ways to handle this another honest man which he applies on him.\n\nOn the other hand, the case of catching the murderers of the union leaders as well as eliminating this dangerous anti-national gang is handed over by the head of the Indian intelligence wing (David) to the hero (Jeetendra) and the heroine (Raakhee). The original clue to start the investigation is a gold medal found with the dead body of a member of this gang. How our hero and the heroine reach the core of this gang and eliminate it, forms the remaining part of the story.\n\nThe Gold Medal is an entertaining crime-thriller made in the style of the seventies. But the problem is the same as mentioned by me in the beginning of this review. The movie got released in 1984 but just by passing through certain scenes of it, it becomes evident to the viewer that its making must have started at least a decade prior to that. The youthfulness visible on the faces of Dharmendra, Jeetendra, Shatrughan Sinha and Raakhee explains the long journey of its making and release in the fraction of a moment. The sets, the presentation style, the actors, the action sequences, the songs and dances; just everything evidences that it is a movie of the early seventies and not the eighties. Hence it appears that the audience of the eighties could not accept it.\n\nBesides, the movie suffers from continuity jerks and unbalance too. The footage got by the heroine, i.e., Raakhee is very less which is perhaps due to the producer&apos;s failure in getting the sufficient number of her dates. Ditto for Shatrughan Sinha. Thankfully, this is not the case with the hero of this movie, i.e., Jeetendra who has carried this movie on his shoulders in his famous jumping jack style with his changing looks (due to the passage of time as the movie got delayed in its completion). In the beginning reels, K.N. Singh is shown as the main villain but the post-interval session shows Premnaath as the main villain who runs the gang from behind the curtain. Still one more villain is there who is termed as the supremo of the gang whose identity is revealed in the ending scene only which fails to convince the viewer because there has been no such indication towards him in the earlier part of the movie. The happenings of the story contain very less relevant to justify the title of the movie.\n\nAll the same, The Gold Medal is an entertaining crime-thriller. The seasoned director has handled the story well despite the obvious limitations and he has been able to present a regular potboiler for the audience liking such movies. Songs and dances have been inserted at different places as per the norm of that period. The movie contains all the regular Bollywood formulae but the less footage for the heroine has diluted the romance element in the story presented on the screen.\n\nShankar Jaikishan have composed forgettable songsc for the movie (it must be Shankar alone because Jaikishan had passed away in 1971). Still the opening song (Aazaadi Aayi Bhi To Kya) which has been picturized on Dharmendra and others is impressive. \n\nAll the actors have performed routinely. However Jeetendra should be admired for getting this movie completed and ensuring that it becomes at least an above average entertainer. Dharmendra is only in the opening sequence of the song - Aazaadi Aayi Bhi To Kya and then the killing of himself and he is perhaps the most impressive performer.\n\nOn the box office, The Gold Medal sank without a trace. Stale movies have to meet this fate only. I recommend The Gold Medal to those movie buffs who enjoy watching crime-thrillers made in the style of the seventies. It won&apos;t disappoint them if seen with a low expectation."",""reviewRating""", , , , ,38.0

Hence it is important that the society provides opportunities to them to utilize their talent and vigor in the right direction.\n\nHaath Ki Safaai (1974) is a run-of-the-mill Bollywood movie based on the &apos;lost and found&apos; formula in which two brothers are separated in their childhood and cross paths in their youth. The title of the movie has been kept after this craft of the hand (Haath Ki Safaai) professionally adopted by the younger one of them. The movie is a very entertaining one.\n\nThe person demonstrating his Haath Ki Safaai in this movie and is proud of this art of himself is Raju (Randhir Kapoor) who was separated from his brother Shankar (Vinod Khanna) in childhood. Both these brothers have grown up in criminalized environment and criminals&apos; company and therefore, become criminals themselves. Raju has become a pickpocket whereas Shankar becomes a gangster. Destiny makes them cross paths time and again and they start disliking each other (without knowing that they are actually brothers). Shankar is happily married to Roma (Simi Grewal) who wants her husband to leave the path of crime and finally, he agrees for that. However the crime world is not a place so easy to quit.\n\nRaju comes across a runaway rich girl - Kaamini (Hema Malini) who is escaping from his uncle who is forcing her to marry Ranjeet (Ranjeet) against her will. Gradually Raju and Kaamini fall in love. But it&apos;s Kaamini only which again becomes a bone of contention between Raju and Shankar. After a lot of drama and action, the brothers finally identify each other and the reunion of all the four lead characters takes place with the arrest of the baddies.\n\nThe USP of this potboiler is the character of Randhir Kapoor alongwith his heart-winning performance. He makes the audience laugh time and again with his perfect comic timing. The memorable comedy song - Peene Waalon Ko Peene Ka Bahaana Chaahiye is a showcase of his comic talent. His demonstration of his pickpocketing art not only justifies the movie&apos;s title but also entertains the viewers very much.\n\nWriters Salim-Jaaved and director Prakash Mehra have done their best in making a thoroughly engrossing movie. The screenplay studded with the frequent encounters of the two male leads is taut and does not allow any boredom to creep in. Action, thrill, romance and sentiments are there in the movie in optimal quantum but it&apos;s the comedy which overpowers everything and adds immense value to this apparently ordinary movie.\n\nIn addition to Randhir Kapoor, the other main characters also have done pretty well. Vinod Khanna won the Filmfare best actor award for his role in this movie. However I admire Simi Grewal very much who was always a natural performer irrespective of the role assigned to her. Hema Malini had started her career a few years back as the heroine of Raj Kapoor but in this movie she is quite at ease while playing the heroine of Raj Kapoor&apos;s son, i.e., Randhir Kapoor.\n\nKalyanji Anandji have composed good music for the lyrics of Gulshan Bawra. Peene Waalon Ko Peene Ka Bahaana Chaahiye (Kishore-Lata) is the most popular song of the album which proves to be no less than a mini laughter show for the audience. But the other songs - Vaada Karle Saajna Tere Bin Main Na Rahoon Mere Bin Tu Na Rahe Hoke Juda, Tumko Mohabbat Ho Gai Hai Humse, Tu Kya Jaane Wafa O Bewafa, Oopar Waale Teri Duniya Mein Kabhi Zeb Kisi Ki Na Khaali Rahe etc. are also quite good.\n\nTechnical aspects are all in order. Production value is decent. The movie is not unduly long.\n\nRandhir Kapoor had not allowed himself to be shadowed by his legendary father (Raj Kapoor) and carved a niche for himself in cine-world through his natural talent and sincere efforts. Haath Ki Safaai is one of his memorable movies which the typical Bollywood movie buffs will like for sure."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Drama""]","""1974-08-30""","""love,husband wife relationship,orphan,gangster,criminal""","""2H17M""",48.0

This song is from the movie - Anpadh (1962) starring Maala Sinha, Dharmendra, Balraaj Saahni and Bindu in lead roles.\n\nAnpadh (illiterate) is the story of Laajwanti (Maala Sinha) who is the sister of a rich landlord Chaudhary Shambhunaath (Balraaj Saahni). The excess affection that she got in her parental house resulted in her remaining illiterate and lacking knowledge of household work also. She gets married to Deepak (Dharmendra) who is a very loving husband. However her not knowing the household chores does not go well with her mother-in-law and sister-in-law. She suffers taunts in this regard but her husband&apos;s love compensates for them.\n\nHowever the sudden demise of Deepak in a mishap brings utter misfortune for Laajwanti. Her mother-in-law expels her from the house when she is pregnant. Right now her brother also cannot support her because he has been sentenced to imprisonment because of committing a murder due to a property dispute. Helpless Laajwanti finds it very difficult to survive in the cruel world especially because she is illiterate and not trained for any job to earn a living.\n\nBut as there are wicked ones in this world, kind ones too. Once Laajwanti comes across good-hearted people after going through many troubles, her life starts recovering. She gives birth to a daughter and fosters her. She herself learns how to read and write as well as the work of stitching clothes and thereby makes a living. Her daughter grows up as Kiran (Bindu). Now comes the final twist in the tale when in order to save her daughter&apos;s honour from a rapist, Laajwanti commits a murder and on the murder spot itself, she meets her lost elder brother Chaudhary Shambhunaath after a gap of several years. The movie ends after an interesting courtroom drama.\n\nAnpadh was made during the early sixties when female education was not stressed in the Indian society. Even the girls of wealthy and high profile families were not getting sufficient education and getting them married in respectable families upon their getting adult was only considered as fulfillment of duty towards them by their parents / guardians. And this situation continued long after that. Hence this movie is to be seen, felt and experienced in the context of the period of its making. Then only it can be enjoyed.\n\nAnpadh is a highly entertaining movie with regular twists in the narrative keeping the spectator glued to the screen. The demise of the hero before the interval point is disappointing but it was required for the script. This family and social drama is woman-centric and the heroine remains at the nucleus of the complete narrative right from the very start to the very finish.\n\nMore than the romantic angle of the hero and the heroine, it&apos;s the brother-sister angle between two lead characters which has got more footage and importance. The affectionate brother does not care for his sister&apos;s education due to remaining under an impression that his wealth won&apos;t allow any such situation that his sister needs to work somewhere to earn a living. But times change. And he realizes his mistake much later when destiny has ruined everything for his delicately fostered (in the parental house) sister. The sister misses her brother very much especially in her time of crisis. This emotional angle is able to touch the hearts of all the loving brothers and sisters.\n\nThe taunting mother-in-law and sister-in-law have always been a fond stuff for the Bollywood filmmakers and mostly they are over the top with the poor daughter-in-law standing like a lamb before them. However the audience of such family dramas is used to seeing such things.\n\nThis black and white movie is technically OK. Music composed by Madan Mohan is the highlight of this movie. In addition to Aapki Nazron Ne Samjha, songs like Woh Dekho Jala Ghar Kisi Ka, Hai Isi Mein Pyar Ki Aabroo, Jiya Le Gayo Ji Mora Saanwariya, Rang Birangi Raakhi Le Ke Aayi Behna etc. are also real gems from the treasure of Hindi cine music. All these songs are considered among Lata&apos;s best renditions. Raja Mehndi Ali Khan has penned the beautiful lyrics which boast of high literary value.\n\nIt&apos;s Maala Sinha&apos;s movie by all means and right from a young unmarried girl to the aged mother of a grown up daughter, she has excelled in her performance. Very young Dharmendra has got a low footage role but he has done his part well. Seasoned actor Balraaj Saahni has delivered his best whereas it&apos;s a pleasant surprise to see the renowned screen cabaret dancer of the seventies - Bindu (who is very young in this movie) to see in a decent role. The classical song - Jiya Le Gayo Ji Mora Saanwariya (based on Raag Yaman) has been filmed on her only.\n\nThe issue of women education has got more and more prominence in later decades and today everybody understands its importance may he / she belong to the lower strata of the society or the middle one or the upper one. This way, Anpadh was ahead of its time and delivered a very pertinent message to the old fashioned Indian society as early as in 1962. I recommend this decent entertainer with a high music appeal and a significant message to all the Hindi movie buffs."",""reviewRating""", , , ,"""2H30M""",60.0

It comprised of limited characters, but magnificently explored throughout the film. To me, all the dialogues were Ironic and all actors delivered brilliantly especially Dharmendra, Pran, Mehmood, and Ashok Kumar.\n\nIf I talk about acting then everyone justified their roles. Dharmendra was mature and realistic, he has some powerful dialogues which can still lit the crisis of our society. Pran was deadliest, meanest man ever. Mehmood has varied emotions and he delivered it perfectly. Hema Malini was an array of beauty, she acted well in most parts of the film. To me, Ashok Kumar was the surprise package. This is the first time I watched him perform, he has blown me away with his natural acting.\n\nMusic is classy, Anand Bakhsi lyrics have powerful meanings. &quot;Duniya O Duniya&quot; and &quot;Naya Zamaana Aayega&quot; will be added to my playlist.\n\n&quot;Naya Zamaana&quot; is a classical cinema, the kind of story which is a story of millions of people who are hopeful for a better time to live in this world.

The movie was a big hit on the box office. However its plot was by no means original. Gomlaal Returns is actually a remake of an old Bollywood comedy - Aaj Ki Taaza Khabar (1973).\n\nAaj Ki Taaza Khabar (today&apos;s breaking news) is the story of Sunil (Kiran Kumar) and his ever-suspicious wife - Geeta (Raadha Saluja) who thinks that her husband is a flirt. One night Sunil unwillingly gets stuck up with a stranger lady and could return to his home the next morning only. Considering his wife&apos;s skeptical nature, he hesitates to tell her the truth and instead, cooks a story with the help of his friend Amit (Asraani) to serve to Geeta to convince her regarding his absence from home for that night. The story contains a fake friend of his named by him as Champak Bhumiya and his fictitious address where he claims to have spent that night. However the situation takes a very interesting turn when Geeta sends a telegram to that imaginary Champak Bhumiya at the address told to her by Sunil and all hell breaks loose when the telegram reaches its destination which is a genuine address and there is a genuine Champak Bhumiya (Paintal) residing at that address. These developments result in a lot of confusion, misunderstandings and laughs (for the audience). Finally, all&apos;s well that ends well.\n\nAaj Ki Taaza Khabar starts hilariously with a henpecked husband and his nagging wife and thereafter the twists and turns coming at regular intervals keep the interest of the viewer alive till the climax. Laughs may not be in plenty but there is no dearth of smiles here. It may not be a great comedy but a satisfactory entertainer for sure. And there is a message for the ever-suspicious wives also (who perceive their husband as regular flirts and skirt-chasers) that such kind of attitude without any concrete basis may prove fatal for the marital bliss of themselves only.\n\nThis is a low budget movie with a middle class milieu rendered to the story. Technically it&apos;s okay as far as the art direction, the cinematography and the editing are concerned. Background score and dialogs are also in line with the comic mood of the movie.\n\nKiran Kumar who perhaps got his true calling in the villainous roles during the eighties and the nineties, had started his career as a hero and this movie is one of those flicks in which he was cast as the hero. He possessed a handsome personality and it&apos;s unfortunate that he could not become a successful hero. He has done well here because he has always been a good actor. Raadha Saluja may not appear to be a heroine material to today&apos;s viewers considering her ordinary looks but she was a good actress. And frankly, if Mallika Sherawat can be a successful heroine, why couldn&apos;t Raadha who was, in many ways, better than Mallika and her likes. Seasoned comedians Asraani and Paintal have generated laughs for the audience, coming true to their reputation in that period. All the other cast members have also done justice to the assigned roles.\n\nShankar Jaikishan&apos;s music is strictly okay. Only one song - Mujhe Meri Biwi Se Bachaao remains in the memory after the movie is over. This song, filmed on Kiran Kumar when he is bathing in the bathroom, is very good to listen and very amusing to watch. Decades later, the words of this song were used as the title of a movie starring Nasiruddin Shah and Rekha (released in 2001).\n\nAaj Ki Taaza Khabar badly flopped on the box office whereas its newer version Golmaal Returns proved to be a huge commercial hit. Well, hype and publicity matter more in today&apos;s time. While recommending this movie as a decent watch to the entertainment-seekers, I also advise those who have seen Golmaal Returns to contrast these two movies. I am sure that like me, they will also find Aaj Ki Taaza Khabar as better than Golmaal Returns."",""reviewRating""", , , , ,49.0

The film is somewhat Naipaulian - it exposes the corruption and darkness of the Indian soul. It is not too big on characterization.

But my personal favourite movie in which tall Amitabh and short Jaya were cast opposite each other is Ek Nazar which got released in 1972. I have watched this socio-romantic movie which contains a murder and a bit of mystery also, many times on satellite channels, yet I am never tired of watching it again and again, not for the sake of any message or inspiration or likewise, but for sheer entertainment and Amitabh-Jaya on-screen chemistry which is magical (perhaps because of the off-screen chemistry between them).\n\nEk Nazar (one glance) was directed by Babu Ram Ishara who was once an assistant of the legendary Bimal Roy. He is better known for his path-breaking bold movies like Chetna and Zaroorat. In this movie he has directed a good story in such a good manner that the engrossing narrative coupled with the good performances and highly melodious songs has become a very good watch for the audience. Thoroughly entertaining and leaving a good feeling after it is over.\n\nThe plot belongs to a courtesan Shabnam (Jaya Bhaduri) who is a big fan of a Shaayar Akash (Amitabh Bachchan) who is actually the son of a big lawyer. One more family is in the scenario which is the family of Akash&apos;s friend Ashok (Raza Murad) who is also a young lawyer and the son of a judge. A meeting of Akash and Shabnam leads to a highly fragrant romance between them. However this romance is not acceptable to Ameena Bai (Nadira) who is the guardian of Shabnam and owner of that Kotha. One distant relative of Ashok&apos;s mother – Deepak (Sudhir) is also visiting the Kotha in the disguise of a Nawab. In Akash&apos;s house also, this relationship is opposed, leading to his leaving his home and residing with a friend who runs a restaurant. Subsequent events flow in such a way that Ameena Bai is murdered and Shabnam is charged and tried for her murder. The court-room drama that follows the murder, ultimately leads to the happy ending of the story.\n\nThe screenplay is very good and the thoughtful direction and good editing has made the movie thoroughly gripping for a viewer to watch. The melodious music serves as the icing on the cake. Though almost all the songs are simply excellent, special mention is deserved by Patta Patta Boota Boota Haal Hamara Jaane Hai whose first two lines have been borrowed from the classic ghazal sung by the legendary singers like Mehndi Hassan and Ghulam Ali. Kishore Kumar and Lata Mangeshkar have sung the ear-soothing songs of the movie which do not hinder the flow of the story, instead they support it and add to its strength.\n\nAmitabh and Jaya have delivered very good performances, courtesy their real life romance in that time. The supporting cast has also done well. I will specially mention firstly for the actor who has played Amitabh&apos;s restauranteer friend (his is a lovely and admirable performance indeed) and secondly for Raza Murad whose debut movie it is. Raza Murad looks very young and he has delivered a knock-out performance in his meaty role. Bollywood did not do justice to this highly talented actor in the later years of his career. He is an awesome actor all the same.\n\nThe director has managed to maintain curiosity throughout the movie despite the fact that the murderer can be guessed by the audience. The motive and the background of the murder remains the mystery which is resolved only in the climax. It is a good entertainer by all means. The use of drawings and water colour paintings in the court-room climax for narrating the flash back events, is a commendable example of directorial creativity and imagination.\n\nI will continue to watch Ek Nazar whenever I get opportunity and I recommend it to all the Amitabh-Jaya fans as well as the people interested in watching a gripping socio-thriller with a good dose of romance."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama"",""Romance""]","""1972-07-28""","""prostitute,father son relationship,forbidden love,class differences,brothel""", ,50.0

The community is oppressed by a powerful gangster named Alphonso. Jesu is an orphan, while Peter is brought up ..."",""","""Growing up together in a remote village, two friends who find themselves as close as brothers learn that the village is under the iron-fisted rule of a treacherous gangster and must stop him from overrunning the village, only to find the task complicated by a massive shark lurking in the nearby waters.\n\nThis was a somewhat troubling if enjoyable effort. One of the film&apos;s biggest issues here is the decision to concentrate on the decidedly non-horror exploits of the gangster ruling over the village. The fact that he&apos;s a crime-lord with a mansion filled with dogs he feeds subordinates to is pretty eccentric, but this is a rather uneventful start to a creature feature film as it keeps the creature off-screen. Detailing the feud between him and the villagers as well as the secondary plot to smuggle out the pearls from the area, this ends up holding back our first shark attack until nearly an hour into the running time. That goes hand-in-hand with the other subplots involving his attempts to rule over the villagers to keep his nefarious plan a secret which just ends up doing the same thing in keeping the shark off-screen. That&apos;s somewhat of a blessing as well with the film&apos;s technical limitations due to the budgetary restrictions. It shouldn&apos;t cost much to make a shark that retains the same basic dimensions and proportions throughout the film yet the shark here is maddeningly and frustratingly inconsistent. Initially appearing to be slightly bigger than a grown person in some attacks, later scenes have the creature big enough to swallow a person within their jaws while an underwater chase is more of a realistic bigger-than-man being. This change in size is carried out with the stiff, plastic-like look of the model inside playsets for the sharks&apos; activities. The storyline rationale for some of the attacks is also a bit clumsy and far-fetched which manage to hold this one back. There are a few things to like here. Despite not having much shark action, the other scenes here depicting the villagers fighting back against the mobsters&apos; goons which result in various clumsily choreographed but energetic kung-fu brawls with the henchmen that offer a fine lead-in to the village raid. The scale is quite grander than expected and has a lot of intensity with the stunt-work featured here, really giving this a big scene much like the thrilling police raid at the compound at the end which has a rather enjoyable action movie tone featuring the gun battles and fighting throughout. That also is what works here with the big confrontation to get the shark out at sea as there&apos;s plenty to like involving the extended battle trying to bring it to the surface while the secondary race to stop the gangster fleeing the scene is a great touch due to the spectacle here of accomplishing both at the same time. Otherwise, there isn&apos;t much else here.\n\nRated Unrated/PG-13", , , ,"""1H53M""",26.0

After she returns from abroad, she is told that she must now prepare to get married to her betrothed, Ratan, who is the son of a close fri..."",""","""Time and again it is proved to me that even the smallest thing takes places only when its due time has arrived. This review had been planned by me one year back upon the sad demise of Nalini Jaywant on 24.12.2010 but its writing kept on getting postponed because I wanted to watch this movie once again before writing the review. And neither could I get a VCD / DVD of it nor found it on internet until Dev Anand passed away on 04.12.2011 after which I checked for it again on internet and got this time.\n\nThe word Munim has an African origin whose meaning is benefactor. However, in our country, the general handymen of big businessmen and landlords were called Munim who used to do all the things related to the business or money-matters (maintaining account-books, controlling cash and other assets, dealing with parties and banks and the likewise). The title of this movie is as such because the hero remains in the get-up of a Munim while working for the villain and is called Munimji (respected Munim)by the heroine.\n\nIt&apos;s the story of Maalti (Nirupa Roy) who gives birth to the son of her wealthy lover who refuses to accept her as his wife and her son as his heir. He has married someone else and got another son through his legitimate wife. Due to his sudden demise, Maalti gets an opportunity to change his other son with her own son and she keeps on living in his house as a maid-servant, taking care of both the children. But now due to the exchange of children by her, her son is called the legitimate son and heir of the deceased person whereas she treats the other child as her own son (i.e, the son of a maid-servant who should serve the master). That son is Amar (Dev Anand) who is devoted to his (apparent) mother - Maalti being ignorant of the injustice that she has done to him and he serves as Munim in the factory of another rich man which is managed by his step-brother, Ratan (Pran). The daughter of that rich man, Rupa (Nalini Jaywant) is the betrothed of Amar since infancy but due to Maalti&apos;s exchange of the male-children, she is considered the betrothed of Ratan. Amar and Ratan hate each other and that hatred is increased only when they become rivals for Rupa&apos;s love. Amar meets Rupa as Raj and she starts loving him whereas he keeps on meeting her in the get-up of Munimji also saying that he is related to Raj and can act as a messenger between herself and Raj.\n\nRatan, on the other hand, is not only a spoiled youth who embezzles factory money for the sake of gambling but he is also a bandit who carries on his activities in the fake name of Kaala Ghoda (black horse). He wants to marry Rupa to get hold of her father&apos;s wealth but he is already secretly married to another girl, Bela (Ameeta). In the climax, Maalti comes to know that the bandit Kaala Ghoda is none else but her son Ratan only. She tells Ratan the truth that she only is his mother and not the mother of Amar who is the actual heir of their father. Ratan imprisons her so that she is not able to tell his true identity to the world and threatens Amar to kill her. For the sake of mother&apos;s life, Amar confesses before the police that he only is the bandit Kaala Ghoda and gets arrested. Ratan is all set to marry Rupa now when the mother gets released from his prison and reaches the matrimonial place to correct her errors and ensure that Amar gets what he deserves.\n\nYoung and dashing Dev Anand and gorgeous Nalini Jaywant have played their parts well and their on-screen romance is pretty impressive. Though DevSaab is over the top in emotional scenes, his dashing personality makes up for the deficiency in acting. Pran as a baddie is good like always and he has generated laughs too for the audience through his performance in the song - Dil Ki Umangen Hain Jawaan. Barely 24 years old Nirupa Roy is completely miscast in the role of the mother of 32 years old Dev Anand. Despite wearing a wig of gray-hair, her youth is not hidden and from no angle does she appear to be that old as the director wanted her to look like. However she has performed well. Ameeta as the clandestine wife-cum-accomplice of the villain has got less scope but has performed satisfactorily.\n\nS.D. Burman&apos;s music is the biggest asset of this movie. The best song is undoubtedly Kishore Kumar&apos;s immortal song - Jeevan Ke Safar Mein Raahi, Milte Hain Bichhad Jaane Ko. Its another version in Lata&apos;s voice is also there in the movie. Other Lata songs in the movie - Nain Khoye Khoye Mere Dil Mein Kuchh Hoye Re, Aankh Khulte Hi Tum Chhup Gaye Ho Kahaan, Ghaayal Hiraniya Main Ban Ban Doloon, Ek Nazar Bas Ek Nazar etc. are also quite melodious and impressive. Shivji Bihaane Chale (Hemant Kumar), Zindagi Hai Zinda (Geeta Dutt) and Dil Ki Umangen Hain Jawaan (Hemant Kumar-Geeta Dutt) are also good to listen. \n\nWhile paying my tribute to late DevSaab and Nalini Ji, I recommend this entertaining movie to one and all. If you are sick of watching the crap being served by several contemporary filmmakers, please watch this musical romance-cum-social drama from the black and white era of Indian cinema and let me assure you that you won&apos;t regret after watching it."",""reviewRating""", , , ,"""2H43M""",67.0

The story, taking place in the editorial department of a leading newspaper, starts well but loses its freshness and becomes a bit typical towards the end, and maybe it just seems dated today. Mala Sinha plays Amita, the managing director of her late father&apos;s company who wishes to entail his legacy of printing a reliable paper based on truth and fairness. The entire concept involving the daily life of people at the offices of the newspaper press, and the values people work with is actually very well presented. It is the triangular love story that follows which is a bit tiresome and kind of uninspiring to me, and sadly at some point it takes over the far more interesting proceedings involving the newspaper, which are more socially relevant. In this regard, a great start which provides a wonderful commentary succumbs to commercial constraints.\n\nIn its favour it can be said that the film benefits from an almost uniformly well-written script and fantastic dialogue. The songs are very good but they are not very suitable and some of them come in overly close proximities in the movie, dragging the narrative. The acting is very good. Mala Sinha, of the most skilled actresses of those times, successfully creates a tough screen persona of a strong and decisive woman with a soft inside. Dharmendra plays the young, idealistic and stubborn young man yet again, and he does it well. Tanuja is bubbly and effective in a role that I think the film would have been better without. Towards the end the film grows increasingly intense and melodramatic and I did not like the tragic ending. But the bottom line is that Baharen Phir Bhi Aayengi is a highly watchable movie from Hindi cinema&apos;s golden era and it&apos;s a worthy effort, particularly for those who enjoy watching Guru Dutt&apos;s cinema."",""reviewRating""", , , ,"""2H19M""",56.0

While Chandni always dreams of a luxurious life, Neeraj wants some of his assignments them be complete. Chandni..."",""","""The year was 1985 and Late Rajesh Khanna was no more a superstar. Yes, he had projects but none of them were powerful enough to revive his career that was on a downward slide. The quartet (Samanta, Pancham, Kaka and Kishore) had come together again to create a magic, but as time would see, Alag-Alag couldn&apos;t become more than a musical hit. During the early and mid-80s the art cinema was at its peak and films like Garm Hawa, Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron, Tarang, Ardh Satya etc. were actually sketching a true portrait of the Indian society. Alag-Alag is very-very filmy, I mean it misses something that could connect it with the paradigm of real world. The story is a simple tale of two individuals, who start off bickering but end up loving each other. The film portrays their struggle and how they manage to get over all the obstacles to ultimately attain their &apos;Zindagi Ka Maqsad&apos; (Life&apos;s Goal) that unfortunately changes twice or thrice in 3 hours. The good thing about Alag-Alag is that it&apos;s loaded with memorable and lingering songs and is also very nostalgic. I watch it whenever I like to take a trip to the mid-80s, when films used to be so stress busting comical creations. Ah! The Wonderful 80s.\n\nNeeraj (Rajesh Khanna) is an aspiring singer, who comes to Mumbai hoping to make it big in the music world. In Mumbai, he lives with his friend Karim (Deven Verma), who assists him in his hunt for opportunities. Even though Neeraj is talented, yet none of the music directors want to give him a chance as a playback singer. He sings for the common people living in the neighborhood and is admired by all.\n\nChandni (Tina Munim) is an innocent runaway village belle, who has come to Mumbai to find a suitable and rich husband for herself. Neeraj and Chandni come across each other and keep fighting over trivial issues. Fate takes Chandni to Dr. Pratap Rana (Shashi Kapoor), who is a successful doctor and lives in a palatial house. Dr. Rana is a widower and Chandni due to her sheer innocence, wants to chance upon him. However, Dr. Rana looks upon her as his daughter.\n\nOne day Neeraj is discovered by a successful actress Sarita (Bindu). Neeraj thinks she could help him getting a chance to perform, but Sarita is actually obsessed with him and wants to pull him into a live-in relationship. When Neeraj comes to know of Sarita&apos;s amorous intentions, he severs his relationship and goes back to Karim. It&apos;s there he realizes that he only loves Chandni and wants to begin his life with her. \n\nChandni is blessed with a melodious voice and Dr. Rana wants to teach her urban mannerism. For this he sends Chandni to Begum Zaidi (Gita Siddharth). On the other side, Neeraj finally gets his long awaited chance to become a playback singer. He makes it big in the world of music and then his &apos;Zindagi Ka Maqsad&apos; shifts to Chandni. He follows Chandni to Begum Zaidi&apos;s house and vows to &apos;kindle the flame of love&apos; in Chandni&apos;s heart. Despite denying earlier, Chandni finally realizes that she loves Neeraj and they thus come on the same note. \n\nChandni wants to go to Dr. Rana and Neeraj decides a spot to meet once she is back. When Chandni goes to Dr. Rana, she finds him on deathbed. Rana dies soon after wishing Chandni a happy life. Now we see that previously Neeraj had a rift with his billionaire Dad (Subbiraj) that led him to Mumbai. He rejoins his family and is now a billionaire too (Wish I were lucky too!). Neeraj wants to meet Chandni but meets an accident that turns him mute (I never knew that injury on vocal chords is a psychological problem. Wonder how they made it up!).\n\nWhen Neeraj doesn&apos;t show up, Chandni is left all alone and homeless. To hide his inability, Neeraj begins to avoid Chandni. Feeling that she has been ditched by Neeraj, Chandni&apos;s &apos;Zindagi ka Maqsad&apos; shifts towards realizing the dreams of now deceased Dr. Rana, who wanted to see her as a successful singer. Neeraj helps Chandni in realizing her goals unbeknownst to her, because now Neeraj&apos;s &apos;Zindagi Ka Maqsad&apos; is to establish Chandni as a successful singer. He begs a great music maestro Mirza ji (Om Shivpuri) to groom Chandni. Well, you see Mirza ji and Karim both live in the same house....Oops this was a goof!\n\nAlag-Alag had scope, but only if it were released in 70s. By early 80s, the audience had adopted a new taste for action films and family dramas. There were so many young and promising faces to challenge an aging Rajesh Khanna. Mithun, Rishi Kapoor, Jackie Shroff, Anil Kapoor, Sunny Deol etc. had a list of successful films behind them. Rajesh Khanna had hits and semi-hits like &apos;Souten,&apos; &apos;Avtaar,&apos; and &apos;Kudrat,&apos;yet I won&apos;t say he was fit for Alag-Alag. He looks too old and his wardrobe doesn&apos;t suit him. I mean, he looks funny with those costumes when he tries to throw his jaded charms acting like a young boy that he surely wasn&apos;t. I guess Shakti Samanta had to cast him as a hero because Kaka produced the film. Samanta should have disagreed with Kaka just the way Mahesh Bhatt did while directing &apos;Naam,&apos; for which producer Rajendra &apos;Jubilee&apos; Kumar asked him to give the part Sanjay Dutt was playing to his own son Kumar Gaurav. Time told that Bhatt was right, else &apos;Naam&apos; would have been a fiasco. Desipte a simple story line with so many unprecedented events, packed with funny twists and turns, &apos;Alag- Alag&apos; is still a strong representative of the 80s, so you can watch it too in case you are a hardcore fan of Rajesh Khanna (like me) and need to take a quick trip to the 80s."",""reviewRating""","[""Family"",""Musical"",""Romance""]","""1985-09-27""","{""total"":0","""2H54M""",37.0

But, this one here is an amateur concoction which lacks good writing.\n\nTukaram (Shreya Talpade) and his wife Sunanda (Manjari Fadnis) are a farmer couple from the state of Maharashtra who have come to Uttar Pradesh with the intention of taking back the land which is rightfully theirs. The land which they claim to have inherited from their forefathers is where the Taj Mahal, one of the seven wonders of the world, now sits. This revelation puts the whole country in a tizzy as politicians and policemen shift in their seats and scramble to get to the root of Tukaram&apos;s alleged claim. The story then employs a comical style as the duo knock the doors of the high court.\n\nThe story is less of a satire and more of a political farce created just to vent the ire regarding the difficulties faced by farmers due to crony commercialization of land. The primary subject of the film being exploration of corruption in land deals around India, the film takes a dig at politicians - both sitting and opposing - who are known to exercise nepotism to help industrialists grab lands from poor farmers who are then left with the only option of suicide. However, the silly premise which the film bases its whole mountainous topic on is hardly entertaining. It reeks of unimaginative writing, with no care given to research.\n\nWith a contemptible twist towards the end, the film faintly brushes on the history of Indian monuments and preaches about the demerits of industrialization which is often cited as a cause for development in India. Talpade is pitiful in this drama as he tries to look appealing in his avatar as a Maratha-faithful farmer. Fadnis should take acting lessons and improve her ability to control her expressions, which are not always helping. Supporting cast is fine, but they are not directed well.\n\nLastly, the title of the film is straightaway misleading. If people are thinking that it talks only about a farmer claiming to own Taj Mahal, then they will only be satisfied for about 5 minutes. Rest is pure contrived nonsense. Overall, this could be a light-hearted watch for a family only because of the theme it explores, but make sure you leave your logical thinking capability at home.\n\nBOTTOM LINE","[""Comedy"",""Drama""]","""2016-09-23""","""farmer""","""2H5M""",6.0

Though Zameendary was &apos;abolished&apos; after India gained independence, it was still heavily illegally practiced in the rural area. Benegal addresses this issue through the story of a young farmer Hari Mondal and his family. Even though Mondal struggles for justice to win back his land, it comes at a high price where his family falls apart.\n\nBenegal&apos;s portrayal is very raw and the the Bengali essence is captured with authenticity through art direction, interaction of actors, setting and the score. All the actors deliver a natural performances. Om Puri is outstanding and he is commendably supported by Victor Banerjee, Noni Ganguly, Pankaj Kapur, Sreela Majumdar and others. The cinematography also deserves special mention as it has a very documentary-like hold that reflects the harsh reality of the issues.\n\nBenegal tackles other issues that arise from poverty. Hari Mondal and his family are of good heart but they are very naive...to the point that they permit Pakhi to go to Calcutta with a stranger who promised her employment.\n\n&apos;Arohan&apos; is among Benegal&apos;s lesser known and underrated works. To me, Hari Mondal is among the most memorable characters. He&apos;s a good hard- working man trying to provide for his family but he&apos;s too naive and gullible for his own good.""},""aggregateRating""","[""Drama""]","""2019-01-02""","""farmer""","""2H24M""",39.0

But the story is more of the struggle within the laborers in which a passionate laborer becomes a pawn of politics and is left to fend his people. In terms of story it definitely takes a turn from the formulaic capers, but the film is unable to shift its focus from the stereotypical image of its hero.\n\nThe film combines the veteran Bengali actors, Anil Chatterjee and Aparna Sen with the Bollywood veterans, Dilip Kumar and Saira Banu.

The silly action scenes seem to have been filmed with kids in mind and the adventures feature Hanuman having people pull on his tail and set it on fire - it&apos;s that kind of production and I wasn&apos;t sure whether I was supposed to be laughing along with it or not.

Then Lakshmi sudde..."",""","""V.K. Prakash&apos;s Phir Kabhi is a dramatic feature which tells the love story of senior citizens, Hari Singh and his teen sweetheart Ganga. A recently-widowed Hari receives a letter from Ganga in which she invites him to take part in a school reunion party with all their past fellows. This sequence, although a tad clichéd, is very nicely done and is filled with nostalgic-laden memories presented through several flashbacks into their past lives as students. There also begins a renewed relationship between Hari and Ganga. Hari is surprised to know that Ganga has never been married, and the two start exchanging letters and even meeting from time to time.\n\nPhir Kabhi&apos;s concept is rather interesting and is well presented. The script is for the most part good, and the narrative is extremely subtle. Director V.K. Prakash effectively directs the film and gives it an engaging feel, although the film has its loopholes, sadly. One example is the fact that Hari&apos;s daughter in-law disapproves of this relationship and he quietly accepts it like one of those disciplined mamma&apos;s boys. I mean, come on, why would any middle-aged man do what his daughter in-law demanded from him, and who is she to give him any orders in the first place? That was quite pathetic and unconvincing and almost ruined the entire film for me.\n\nWhere the movie easily makes up for any of its flaws is in the performances. Mithun Chakraborty is excellent as Hari and he looks incredibly authentic in a role that gives him full scope to showcase his great acting skills. It&apos;s almost impossible to believe it is actually the one who played the Disco Dancer Jimmy and the action hero of so many flicks. Note the scene right after the death of his wife, when he cannot find his glasses and mistakenly calls his wife. Just see his deep devastation when he suddenly recollects that she is actually no more. Dimple Kapadia is also well cast to support Chakraborty and she delivers a restrained performance. Gulshan Grover is very good in his role, and the rest of the cast lend adequate support.\n\nPhir Kabhi is an interesting film and in spite of its flaws, does leave a mark. The performances, particularly that of Chakraborty, easily make it a watchable feature."",""reviewRating""", , , , ,14.0

While travelling to his estate in the company of Whiskey, Rohit meets with beautiful Neena (Sadhana), and falls in love..."",""","""Aap Aaye Bahaar Aayee (primavera has arrived alongwith you) starts with the love story of Rohit (Rajendra Kumar) and Neena (Saadhana). They decide to marry. Meantime Rohit&apos;s friend Kumar (Prem Chopra) also sends his marriage proposal to Neena with his photograph and to his utter humiliation, Neela tears off his photograph even without casting a look at it. This sense of humiliation and defeat turns Kumar into a maniac and he rapes Neena. Now Neena, considering herself as impure, is no longer willing to marry Rohit. However Rohit does not leave her and marries her. She gives birth to a son which, in all probability, is a result of the rape imposed on her by Kumar. Now Neena is living the life of a wife and a mother with all the social respect and her husband&apos;s abundant love being available to her but the thing is that the woman in her has died an untimely death. However Rohit, being a true lover, is ever-trying to keep her happy by all means and he has no issues with the kid also whom he gives all the fatherly love that he has in his heart. The story again gets a twist when years later, Kumar comes back to complete his revenge (he had lost an eye in the post-rape tussle). The climax takes the baddie to the destination he deserves and renders security and happiness to the aggrieved family.\n\nAap Aaye Bahaar Aayee starts just like a regular romantic movie made in the style of the sixties and we find the lead pair interacting like their earlier romantic movies. However a few reels later, the movie turns serious and the trauma resulting from Neena&apos;s rape takes the driver&apos;s seat for the narrative to move ahead. The movie is an engrossing one though the tension post the rape makes it a bit heavy. I contrast the rape incident and its aftermath in the conjugal life of the lead pair with that shown in an earlier movie - Satyakaam (1969). In Satyakaam also, the raped lady, despite abundant unconditional love of her husband for her, is not able to establish normal conjugal relations with him because of the negative effect of rape on her mind and heart. And an interesting trivia is that in Satyakaam also, the name of the rapist is Kumar only.\n\nDirector Mohan Kumar has handled the sensitive subject very well and underscores the significance of the people who genuinely love the raped lady, in her life. Through the character of Neena, he has very accurately portrayed that though the love of the close ones is able to apply ointment on the wound on her soul, finally the biggest healer is time only and nothing else. Despite application of love and sympathy, the victimized lady may take years to be normal within her heart. And that calls for a lot of patience on the part of those who love her, who live with her and who console her. The narrative moves steadily and finally, leaves a strong impact on the heart of the audience who start empathizing with the victim and her beloveds. It also underscores this fact that the attitude of the people should be positive and sympathetic towards the child who might take birth as a result of such crime. After all, that kid is an innocent one and had no hand in his birth. Then why should he suffer ? Rape is a sin but who is the sinner. The rapist is the sinner, not the rape-victim or the child thus born.\n\nNow with the changing times at least in terms of mentality of both the men and the women, at least the womenfolk should bear in their mind that getting raped by misfortune is not to be considered as the end of their life or happiness. They should face this reality with courage and make a fresh start of their life. When the rapist does not feel any guilt for whatever he has done, why should they feel any guilt about it when the sin took place with their physic without their will and therefore, it was an imposed one. Every such female may not be fortunate like Neena of Aap Aaye Bahaar Aayee who gets such a sincere lover who marries her and stands by her in all the bad times including the rape and after. She should not lose heart all the same. After all, life is more precious than anything else. And times are bound to change. One never knows what is in store for him / her in the times to come.\n\nThis admirable movie got further elevation through the brilliant performances of the lead actors. Both Rajendra Kumar and Saadhana have done very well with outstanding on-screen chemistry between them. Both were past the peak of their careers as lead actors at the time of this movie. However they have made this last movie done together by them a memorable one. Prem Chopra as the villain is also perfect. He has portrayed the jealousy and sense of humiliation in Kumar with finesse. The complete supporting cast has done its part well.\n\nLaxmikant Pyarelaal&apos;s music alongwith Anand Bakshi&apos;s lyrics is also a big plus point of this movie. All the songs - the title track, Koyal Kyun Gaaye, Poochhe Jo Koi Mujhse Bahaar Kaisi Hoti Hai etc. are all ear-soothing ones. The best song is definitely Mujhe Teri Mohabbat Ka Sahaara Mil Gaya Hota which signifies the essence of the movie.\n\nAap Aaye Bahaar Aayi is a praiseworthy movie which is many notches above many other movies made on this theme. It was a box office hit and could have fared even better had it been made prior to the era of Rajesh Khanna. The audience of golden oldies should not miss it."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Drama"",""Romance""]","""1971-07-05""","""love,four word title,friendship,businessman,pregnancy""","""1H59M""",51.0

He is in debt, but continues to borrow money so that he could provide a better life for his family. ..."",""","""After watching such movies as Boot Polish and Jagte Raho, produced by the great Raj Kapoor, I could not miss Ab Dilli Dur Nahin. The premise was very interesting, and the film is quite good, but not as good as expected. The film imparts the journey of Ratan, a little kid who goes on foot to Delhi (Dilli) to save his father from death. His mother died of a snake bite and soon afterwards his father was charged with murder and convicted to death penalty for no fault of his own. After the father is sent to Delhi to await his death sentence, the kid meets a petty thief who confirms that at the time of the murder he saw his father sleeping near his wife&apos;s grave. That&apos;s when his journey to meet the Indian prime minister of the time, Jawaharlal Nehru and prove his father&apos;s innocence begins. And he has many obstacles to overcome.\n\nGenerally a watchable movie telling the story of hope and struggle, Ab Dilli Dur Nahin was a rather experimental film at the time, and the one who fearlessly invested his money in this project was none other than the great Raj Kapoor. This is actually one of the least famous films he produced. The film&apos;s title itself, which is more of a slogan, made me go and watch it. Though it is definitely worth the watch, it&apos;s not flawless. I liked the beginning a lot, and I found the portrayal of the family and the couple very convincing and moving. This portion of the film shows how people, despite financial difficulties and hardships, were happy with what they had. Unfortunately the death of the female heroine happens too soon and it&apos;s a sad view, and the following proceedings only add to the tragedy.\n\nThe film&apos;s songs are lovely, but they are so many that at times they just drag the narrative. The director does try to portray the story realistically, but at times the film gets a bit melodramatic and the main conflicts as well as the villains make it look more of a fairy tale. As far as acting is concerned, the film&apos;s main protagonist is the kid Master Romi, and he does reasonably well but never well enough. The supporting child actors do much better, for what it&apos;s worth. Motilal does very well in his role, while Soluchana Latkar is excellent in her brief appearance. Anwar Hussain makes for an ordinary villain. The film&apos;s ending is very sugarcoated and is easy to predict. I thought the movie would have worked better as a children&apos;s movie, but it was far too serious. Ab Dilli Dur Nahin may not be a great film, but it has a good concept and it is an altogether appreciable effort."",""reviewRating""", , , ,"""2H13M""",65.0

She also chooses an interesting theme that is considered controversial in India, that of a successful independent divorcée with two children being in a relationship with and wanting to marry a younger man.

The songs are below average (a few are quite dreadful) and they appear randomly, visualized like MTV videos. Keshav Arora is another weak link. His acting, especially when he confronts Simi after his mother&apos;s departure, is very poor. The rest of the cast are space-fillers.\n\nThe one to keep her head up high is the gorgeous Deepshika as the leading lady.

Since at one end I got to see their latest projects (despite a limited release) expecting something extra-ordinary justifying their cult image but on the other, have to review them impartially too pointing towards their major shortcomings without getting influenced by the nostalgic factor associated with their reputed names.\n\nHowever the situation becomes worse when you get to see a downright trashy film from the man behind much appreciated projects such as JAANE BHI DO YAARON, KABHI HAAN KABHI NA, KYA KEHNA and the life teaching serial NUKKAD, forcibly making you think about skipping the review to avoid the severe harsh assessment deserved by the awful project. Honestly I wasn&apos;t expecting Kundan Shah&apos;s latest film P SE PM TAK to be that bad and this eventually puts me in the same tough situation as previously experienced while reviewing the last films of Dev Anand and Subhash Ghai.\n\nInterestingly when it comes to the old-timer experts of our Hindi film industry still working in the present scenario, we are unable to find personalities like Clint Eastwood who amazingly manages to deliver great films even in his eighth decade of life celebrating the spirit of cinema. May be it&apos;s our different working patterns, questionable system or other social (personal) factors that might be the cause behind such repeated failures. Yet the truth remains that here we have seldom seen a director playing a long consistent innings till the last phase of his life churning out cinematic gems.\n\nReturning to Kundan Shan and his P SE PM TAK, where P stands for &apos;prostitute&apos; as per the film&apos;s impractical storyline, it can easily be rated as one of the most tacky and annoying black satires that fails to grab your attention right from its first scene. Revolving around a bold girl&apos;s journey from a brothel to the major political stage becoming the Chief Minister (the post of PM is only used as a reference in the end), the film refuses to talk logic and remains mediocre in execution with all uninteresting sequences coming one after another with many terribly written dialogues muted more than 15 times by the censors with a beep. A badly conceived film based on a weird subject, its neither a comedy nor any satire with the most irritating factor remaining its background score that keeps screaming loudly in almost every scene unnecessarily.\n\nHaving a quite poor script progression and a distasteful style of narration, the film features an otherwise beautiful girl Meenakshi Dixit in the lead, trying hard to deliver a noteworthy performance in vain, looking unconvincing throughout in the given role. Plus its really painful to see the entire known supporting cast acting as amateurs including Bharat Jadhav, Aanjjan Srivastav, Deepak Shirke, Mushtaq Khan, Yashpal Sharma and the lesser known face Indrajeet Soni. Interestingly the ugly get-up of the minister also reminded me of a similar one tried by Kamal Hassan in his film MAYOR SAAB.\n\nThe below average songs inserted at regular intervals just for the sake of it keep irritating you constantly and then the post interval inclusion of an absurd idea of a corpse made active again (speaking, walking and even dancing) through a remote control and some electronic gadgets fitted in the body by an eccentric scientist, makes you look at the screen with an unbelievably shocking amazement and jaws dropped. Perhaps director Kundan Shah is still somewhere stuck in the fascination of using a corpse as an entertaining prop in the storyline since JAANE BHI DO YAARON released three decades back. But here the particular senseless sequences with all forced humour turn out be a big disappointing let-down from the experienced director unarguably.\n\nSumming up, frankly this is not what we expected from the &apos;once creative genius&apos; Kundan Shah. And it&apos;s actually quite disturbing to admit that a film like P SE PM TAK will now get included in the filmography of the same person who will also be remembered as the vision behind JAANE BHI DO YAARON, one of the first five cult black comedies of our Hindi Cinema. Unfortunately a fact that is sure going to confuse many students in the future studying the hugely contradicting body of work of the well-known director."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Drama""]","""2015-05-29""","""prostitute""","""2H3M""",7.0

The interior shots, that take most of the film, are also remarkable in the use of various lighting sources and the ever flowing curtains.

The men are far away in the big city, working to support their families, and the wives remain all alone, trying to survive the routine life by working in the fields and taking care of the kids, quietly awaiting their husbands&apos; letters. From one post to another, the man find a way to satisfy themselves by visiting various brothels and sharing nights with different prostitutes, expecting their wives to remain loyal. But when a young city man named Mansukh visits the village, he manages to lay down several women. His personal project, however, is one woman named Taku, who is known to be the most decent of the women in the village, and who would not allow him to get even mildly close to her. But one day she too gets lost in her loneliness and her desire wins her principles. On top of that, she finds out she is pregnant and instantly lets her husband know about her betrayal once he comes back. While the husband thinks of forgiving her this one mistake, he is surprised by her firm assertion that she will never abort this child. That&apos;s where starts a great dilemma.\n\nInteresting and engaging, Rihaee may surprise many with its honest and in-your-face portrayal of themes which had rarely been dealt with in Hindi cinema earlier. The film&apos;s proceedings are at times really shocking and unbelievable and are handled quite well, although at times I felt a kind of banality in the way the infidelity was depicted, given the fact that such incidents rarely happen, particularly in such culturally and socially conservative and rural areas in India. The film&apos;s main idea and purpose is to address women empowerment and to raise a voice against discrimination in this regard. Raje&apos;s portrayal of the story is feminist but fair, and although the film does manage to provoke different personal thoughts, somewhere she fails to achieve the necessary sensitivity it requires and it is not uniformly convincing. The main conflict, however, would definitely bring to different opinions among viewers who see the film and interpret the main situation from their personal points of view, and that&apos;s an achievement on its own. I too have my own opinion about it, but I would keep it to myself as it does not belong here.\n\nNow to the main reason Rihaee is ever mentioned and discussed, and it&apos;s obviously the great Hema Malini; this is one of Malini&apos;s lesser known roles, and according to me one of her most underrated works. As Taku, she shows how deep she can go in her exploration of a woman&apos;s mind. This is a role one would usually expect to see Shabana Azmi or Smita Patil playing, but Malini does a great job of it. She convincingly displays the many shades of her character, including Taku&apos;s toughness, vulnerability, inner conflict and regret and at the same time her steady determination and willingness to fight the entire world for her rights. Vinod Khanna is excellent as her loving and tormented husband. Naseeruddin Shah plays the young Casanova who woos all the lonely and frustrated wives of the village, and he unsurprisingly nails the part. Rihaee is a good film. It may have its flaws, but its message is clear and successfully conveyed. Above all, it will be remembered mostly for Hema Malini&apos;s performance."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama""]","""1988-08-31""","""f rated""","""2H38M""",34.0

The theme of this story contains the activities of somebody who has lost a lot in the hands of the criminals and thus developed a death wish in his heart. He wants to die but instead of dying in the normal way, he wants to die in his bid to eliminate as many criminals as he can. This story has inspired many novels and movies in India. Aakhiri Adaalat(1988) also seems to have been inspired by Death Wish only because it shows a group of public-spirited people who are aggrieved in their personal lives because of the criminals roaming about the society. Fostering death wish in their hearts, such people now fearlessly go after the criminals and eliminate them, terming it as the justice of their court(Adaalat).\n\nAakhiri Adaalat(the final court) starts with a gang of hardcore criminals who have taken the city to ransom by their law-breaking activities. This gang consists of Girija Shankar(Paresh Rawal), Shiv Saran(Gulshan Grover), Bansidhar(Sarat Saxena), Mahaveer Shah(Girdhar), Raghunathan(Roopesh Kumar) etc. alongwith their henchmen. Honest and dutiful cop Inspector Amar(Vinod Khanna) is after them but his style of functioning is not liked by his seniors like the Deputy Superintendent of Police(Shafi Inaamdaar) and the Commissioner of Police(Sudhir Dalvi). The DSP himself is sold out in the hands of these criminals and helps them in different ways. Amar lives with his widow mother(Sushama Seth). Nitin Sinha(Jackie Shroff) is Amar&apos;s fast friend who lives with his widow mother Mrs. Sinha(Seema Dev). Nitin loves Nisha(Sonam) who is the daughter of Barrister Shankar Sharma(Vinod Mehra) who apparently does not like the affair of his daughter with Nitin. Amar and Barrister Sharma are also not on good terms because the criminals caught by Amar with a lot of effort are acquitted by the court due to the efforts of Barrister Sharma who pleads for them. To keep a vigil on Amar as well as to restrain his enthusiasm, the DSP gives him an assistant in the form of Sub-Inspector Reema(Dimple). However within a span of time, Amar and Reema fall in love.\n\nSuddenly a killing spree starts in the city against the criminals. The killer wears a specific leather jacket and a specific helmet covering his whole face and he arrives on a motorbike to take on the outlaws. Many criminals including some of the high profile gangsters mentioned above are killed by the biker. Since the identity of the killer is not known, it is also not clear whether it is the same person every time or just the get-up is the same used by different people on different occasions. Amar alongwith Reema is after this mysterious murderer but all his efforts go in vain. And the tragedy is that Amar himself comes under the suspicion of being this mysterious helmet-wearing biker who kills the criminals. First Reema suspects him because a similar leather jacket and a similar helmet is found in a closet of his bedroom, then after knowing the fact from Reema, Amar&apos;s mother also accuses him to be this mysterious killer. A disheartened and demoralized Amar who now feels as completely lonely in the world, leaves his own house. He gets suspended also by his department.\n\nTo wash the stain of being the killer himself from his name, Amar investigates the things in his personal capacity and gradually some new and startling facts come to the fore. Amar comes to know now that the killer is not a single individual but there is a full-fledged organization populated by public-spirited people who hate crime and criminals. Different members of this group wear the publicized get-up of the killer, use the bikes and eliminate the criminals because they are disenchanted with the reigning judicial system which appears more to be in favour of the criminals than the law-abiding citizens. The reason behind this disenchantment and their rebellious attitude towards the society and the law is that they had not got justice from the same when they were aggrieved.They call their organization their own court in which they themselves play the roles of judge, jury and executioner together for the criminals who deserve the strictest punishment as per their philosophy of justice. They have lost their desire to live and it&apos;s the death wish in their hearts that has made them daredevil.\n\nOn the other side, now only one gangster - Girija Shankar is left among his group because all others have been killed by the jacket and helmet wearing biker. He decides to use the myth of the helmet-wearing biker-killer now well-set in the public-psyche to his advantage. He starts killing the innocents while wearing that get-up and riding a bike, thus maligning the image of that mysterious-killer in public. Now the members of this unusual society have to prove that they do not kill innocents and some oversmart criminal is killing the innocents while hiding his true identity behind the get-up known to be belonging to them. They seek Amar&apos;s help in this regard though Amar considers it his duty to arrest them and handover to the law. In the end, the villain, i.e., Girija Shankar is caught by Amar with the help of the corrupt DSP(who has had a change of heart). However what the court established by the system and the law of the land decides for this self-designated court, remains a question which the filmmaker does not answer.\n\nThe corrupt and ineffective judicial system of India in which the proceedings move at a snail&apos;s pace with no hope for justice for the victims, does not recognize such parallel courts or clandestine societies running a crusade against crime. But they may be welcome by the aggrieved and victimized underdog if they do emerge in India also the way they had emerged in many other countries long long back."",""reviewRating""", , , ,"""2H28M""",34.0

He takes shelter in a house and takes a hostage."",""","""Andha Yuddh (1987) narrates the tale of two such used ones only out of whom one is an outlaw and the other one is a cop. Both realize quite late that the war being blindly carried out by them is actually not theirs and they are not aware of the real motives of the masterminds behind as well. Andha Yudhh (blind war) starts with the murder of the chief minister of the state. The killer – Raaja (Raj Babbar) is running away from the police when he gets shelter in a home holding the only person available there at that time as captive who is a handicapped girl – Saroj (Pallavi Joshi). Dutiful cop – Suhaas Daandekar (Nana Patekar) is chasing him and now seeing that he has held the handicapped girl as captive in his bid to escape from there, he works out different plans to catch him. He seeks the help of a doctor (K.K. Raina) and a nurse - Maadhuri Paande (Divya Rana) in this regard. The nurse enters the household under the pretext of administering the essential medicine to the handicapped girl and tries to give a sedative to Raaja but fails. All the family members of Saroj alongwith the cops, i.e, Suhaas and his subordinates plus the press reporters are witnessing the high tension drama involving two sides with different motives – a cat and mouse game, putting it straight. \n\nOn the other hand, an emotional interaction goes on between Saroj and Raaja inside the house. Saroj who herself is highly depressed because of her crippled condition and a bleak future, asks many questions from Raaja taking him down his memory lane containing several painful incidents that took place in his childhood and youth. She puts up certain ethical questions before him and they share a lot, despite Saroj still fearing Raaja and Raaja still not relying upon her sympathies towards him. Raaja has been led to commit this murder through a brainwashing of him, making him believe that he would be serving a noble cause by doing it. Gradually Raaja realizes that he has been misguided and used to carry out that evil deed by someone who has been benefited from that. Saroj asks him to surrender to the law but Raaja has some different intentions. He seeks clear path from the cops to escape from there with Saroj by threatening to kill her. Before that he gets her clad in a red sari. Suhaas follows them and kills Raaja upon getting the first opportunity to nail him. Before that Raaja has conveyed to Saroj the name of the person who got the CM murdered through him and Saroj conveys the same to Suhaas. Now Suhaas also realizes that himself was in a blind war with Raaja and his position is no better than that of Raaja. In fact, both have been pawns in the hands of the real chess player, making moves from both the sides. This realization of Suhaas paves the way for the finale of this movie.\n\nAndha Yuddh is a very impressive movie with no songs or regular Bollywood formulae like romance, comedy or fight. It is an out and out realistic intense drama which keeps the viewer hooked. The viewer seldom realizes that the regular entertainment factors are absent in this movie because already there is so much to keep him tied to his chair. The plight of Raaja and his exploitation moves the viewer deep within.Through the character of Raaja, the filmmaker has emphatically underscored this fact that man is nothing but the product of his experiences. One can give back to the society only what he has got from it in the first place. When the society itself turns an innocent into a criminal, what can he repay to it ? \n\nProducer Neeta Sharma herself has written the story of this movie which is damn good and brought on the screen by the director Dayaal Nihalani with a high degree of proficiency. The movie is engrossing right from the word go to the very finish and provides enough food for thought that can be utilized by the thinking viewers to make a better society.\n\nThe final act of Suhaas appears to have been created to please the front-benchers and not in line with the mood of the movie. I fail to understand when the filmmaker did not give a damn for the tried and tested formulae for creating the major part of the movie, then why the hell did he go for an utterly Bollywoodish finale ? If he wanted to make a formula-studded commercial movie, then he could have made the whole movie in that style only.\n\nThe highlight of this movie is the performances. Nana Patekar as the no-nonsense dutiful cop on one hand and Raj Babbar as the misguided outlaw on the other, have delivered towering performances. I especially admire Raj Babbar who showed his mettle in the difficult role of the hero who appears as the villain. Then we have Pallavi Joshi whose talent never got justice from Bollywood. She has done superbly in the meaty role of the handicapped girl whom we can consider the heroine of the movie also. Divya Rana as the nurse has also done exceedingly well.\n\nThe director has done the rightest thing by keeping the movie free from songs. The background score prepared by Ajit Varman is highly admirable. Technically the movie is excellent with the realistic settings and praiseworthy camera work. \n\nAndha Yuddh is a movie which entertains though it is not meant to entertain. Instead it is meant to provoke thoughts in the audience. Let&apos;s not allow ourselves to be used by the selfish ones who might be willing to exploit our precious time and energy for their vested interests. Let&apos;s utilize our wisdom and strength for positive and desirable objectives, preserving them from the blind wars that might be imposed on us."",""reviewRating""", , , , ,35.0

She hitches a ride from ace Grand Prix racer, Ram Khanna, an..."",""","""Feroz Khan has always facinated me.Although he was a dashing looking man who had oodles of style and less of acting talent I really admired the movies he made.Feroz Khan can easily be said as the most stylish filmmaker this side of pacific.The movies which he made generally revolved around sex,violence and some great music.Still he would show these elements with such style that his fans still have fond memorie of the movies he made.His most famous movie as a film-maker has been Qurbaani,yet his other movies also carry the typical Feroz Khan stamp with much success.Last year when I was bed-ridden following an operation I decided to watch &apos;Apradh&apos;, the movie from where The Feroz phenomena began. Ram(Feroz Khan) is a dashing Formula-1 race driver(Karthikeyan is still trying to be one) and is in Europe to take part in the world championship.He is India&apos;s hope at the race.He meets a thief Meena(Mumtaz) by chance.Meena is on a move after stealing a Rs. 15 lakh necklace(2,00,000 U.S. dollars in those days according to the jeweller).Meena hides the necklace in Ram&apos;s attire in a moment of fear.Meena keeps getting back to Ram in search of the necklace as her bosses want the necklace.When Ram comes to know about the whole thing he not only rescues Meena from the gang but falls in love with her as well.In the meantime he manages to win the Formula-One race as well(Indians are still dreaming that one day some Indian will actually do this). After winning the race Ram decides to return to India.A stranger gives him a bottle which supposedly contains medicines which are meant for his elder brother Harnam.However the bottle contains diamonds and Ram is taken by the police. On being released and returning to India Ram feels that he will live a simple life and would not induge in any criminal activities.He marries Meena and they live happily till Harnam(Prem Chopra) comes to them.Diamonds and Meena create a misunderstanding between the brothers.To make matters worse one f Harnam&apos;s men breaks away from him and swears to kill Ram.After having lived the life of a criminal for long Harnam finally dies while protecting Ram from the bullets being fired from his own men. In 1993 when I watched Baazigar,I could not stop praising Abbas-Mustan for shooting a motorcar race in a hindi movie.Last year when I watched Apradh I was shocked to see that the hero of the movie is shown as a Formula One race driver.Clearly the story of Apradh written by Akhtar-Ul-Iman was way ahead of its time.It was aided by a tight screenplay and good dailogues.Another plus point of the movie is its good music.the songs &apos;Tum Mile Pyaar se...&apos; and &apos;Hamaare Sivah..&apos; are popular to this day.kalyanji-anandji formed a dream team with Feroz Khan starting with Apradh.Surprisingly they use Kishore(instead of Feroz&apos;s favourite Mukesh) as the voice of Feroz Khan which yields good results.Technically the film is brilliant.The cinematography,sound recording,action sequences,editing and above all the locations are absolutely fabulous. Feroz Khan looks his dashing best in Apradh.Although Feroz became a popular star in early star but he was famous for his supporting roles.This pushed him to become a filmmaker so that he gets a good lead role.Feroz acts quite well and fits in easily to the role of Formula One Race driver.Mumtaz also looks good and acts decently.The film has some bad acting by the side villains specially the actors who played the gang members of Mumtaz. However if there is one performance which lingers on even after the movie is over it is that of Prem Chopra&apos;s.Apradh is arguably Prem Chopra&apos;s best performance till date.In a role which gave him ample opportunity to be that bad guy yet be human and have emotions for his younger brother even till the end Chopra gives a sterling performance.Starting from Apradh was another Feroz Khan tradition that was followed in all F.K.International movies.The tradition was that the other lead actor would die in the end and will have a more power packed role as compared to Feroz himself.Whether it is Prem nath in Dharmatma,Vinod Khanna in Qurbaani,Anil kapoor in Jaanbaaz or Vinod Khanna in Dayavan,all followed this trend.It is quite surprising that Feroz never casted Prem Chopra after the success of Apradh. To say the obvious,Apradh belongs to Feroz Khan the filmmaker.His work as a producer is evident from the high class production balues of the movie.But it is his work as a director which really impresses.The western influence is very visible throghout the movie.Foreign locales,cabarets,gangsters and the murder of the lady in bath-tub show that Feroz was highly influenced by English movies.But Feroz surprised me the way he handled the emotional scenes and the bonding between the brothers.He is totally in form even while handling the most Hindustani emotion.The icing on the cake however is the way in which he has shot the Car Race.It is said that he shot the famous Nuremberg Car Race(Germany) with the aid of a prince from the royal family of the Leopolds.I am still waiting for any Indian director to show a car race similar to this one in a Hindi movie. Apradh when released in 1972 was a hit and it started the trend of Feroz Khan&apos;s stylised Hindi movies.\n\nPros ","[""Action"",""Thriller"",""Romance""]","""1972-04-21""","""character repeats someone else&apos;s dialogue,germany,frame up,directed by star,false accusation""","""2H8M""",50.0

Bhola, a snake worshiper, helps them escape so they protect him and his sister."",""","""I love campy, over the top, totally preposterous films with a cast of thousands that can only come out of Bollywood and Sheshnaag is near the top of the list in this category. Two magical snakes who can become human (a la Sridevi in Nagina) and grant wishes, a beautiful woman and a drunken husband, a maharaj who wants to become an immortal god, an evil real-estate developer with an innocent daughter and a wise fool whose flute playing summons animals and who also falls in love with the aforesaid daughter... what&apos;s not to love?? The story gets lost in its own intricacies, the costumes are cheesy and shoddy, the special effects are horrific, but it&apos;s still just such implausible fun, although I don&apos;t think it was meant to be humorous originally. It&apos;s one of those movies that is so bad that it&apos;s good. (You get the feeling that director K. Reddy must have said &quot;Let&apos;s see if this works...it couldn&apos;t hurt!&quot; every single day of shooting.) Part of what saves Sheshnaag is the cast. Jeetendra as the magical boy snake is his usual earnest, heroic self and paired with Madhavi as his girl snake partner. (Madhavi&apos;s got mad snake dancing skills, but truthfully Jeetendra does not-part of the hilarity of that scene.) Rekha is, of course, the beautiful, poor woman married to Anupam Kher&apos;s character. Both of these actors always give a thousand percent in any film they do, and this is no exception. Rekha is always pure joy with her dignity and grace, her dancing breath-taking. Anupam Kher is in the surprising role of bad guy and this was made when he had hair, so it&apos;s worth it just for those two things. Rishi Kapoor is the wise fool who in love with Mandakini&apos;s character. And Danny Denzongpa absolutely ROCKS as the power hungry maharaj. He&apos;s a well-known Bollywood villain who actually, I think, gives Om Prakash a run for his money in that category. Don&apos;t watch this film for any depth ot lessons or even good special effects-because you won&apos;t find that. But you will find a absolutely classic example of masala film gone crazy, and that makes it really fun."",""reviewRating""", , , ,"""2H25M""",32.0

She&apos;s very much cast as the typical heroine but her natural charisma, beauty and flair for comedy easily make her stand out. Meanwhile Farha fails to do much with a non-challenging thankless role. Rishi Kapoor is plain boring while Sunny Deol does surprisingly well in some of the comedic sequences (especially when he dresses in drag). With the exception of &quot;Keh De Khul Ke Keh De Duniyawalon Se&quot;, the songs are fairly forgettable but Rishi Kapoor&apos;s atrocious dancing always provides some unintentional comic relief while Juhi Chawla gets to display some of her dancing skills with energy and grace. &apos;Izzat Ki Roti&apos; is as forgettable as they come but it&apos;s certainly not the worst of its kind.""},""aggregateRating""","[""Drama""]","""1993-08-13""","""car accident,businessman,childbirth,attempted suicide,release from prison""", ,29.0

A young lady fights for this against her family&apos;s will and job. On this backdrop, the film tries to raise a voice on patriotism and politics.\n\nThe story is pretty exaggerated and is full of gore and violence. But the story stands for symbolism to the increasing violence, crimes in the city for which the film deserves an attention. Well, I won&apos;t say the film goes for a suitable answer by the end; but the story telling is quite remarkable in the film and the treatment is surprisingly different from the 80s movies.\n\nThe film has a rawness and keeps you disturbed for most of the time. Perhaps the content won&apos;t be suitable to be watched with family. It manages to grip and comes close to an intense thriller. The special mention needs to go to the powerful performances given by Sujata Mehta and Rohini Hattangadi in their central roles. Besides, it would be unfair not to mention Nana Patekar in his earlier yet one of his best performances. Most of his dialogues make a satire to the current politics. Despite a non salable cast, the film manages to grip. Overall, the film raises the voices against the increasing crime and violence in the country and hints the unwillingness of the law and order to terminate it.\n\nAnyway, I have a reservation for this movie; and it&apos;s the lack of reality to the story which views the story in a fairy land where only a single mobster has the power to terrify the whole city with his fury. Perhaps the law and order of a city at present may not be that lame as portrayed in the film. Had the story been a bit real to life, &quot;Pratighaat&quot; would have been a remarkable film to be remembered for years.

Today I see it as another Hindi melodrama which is generally poorly scripted and directed, but I think it does have its moments. This is the story of Ravi Kumar, a young street guy who has a noticeable singing talent. When a young rich woman named Radha hears him singing one of the songs she penned, she asks her dad to help him. This marks the beginning of a successful career for Ravi, and more importantly a relationship between him and Radha, who are already deeply in love with each other. But problems arise soon, when Ravi is already at the top of his career; Radha is surprised by Ravi&apos;s sudden change in attitude as he is continuously ignoring her in every possible way. This comes to a peak when he does not acknowledge her contribution towards his success upon getting an award. Those who have watched Hindi films of this sort could successfully predict what this is all about.\n\nKalaakaar starts quite well and the first half is fairly interesting. The second half, however, is very poor and it presents a certain twist that people today would compare to films like Kal Ho Naa Ho. The script is quite poor and the ending is particularly abysmal, being overly tragic and hard to believe. The leading role of Ravi is played by Kunal Goswami, who is hardly known today. He is very average in this film, although it&apos;s good that they did not cast some old guy to play a young achiever. Sridevi on the other hand is the film&apos;s saving grace where casting is concerned. She is very pretty and rises above the script with a convincing performance, doing pretty well even in the most terrible sequences. Well, and to the main reason this film is ever mentioned today, which is of course the music by Kalyanji-Anandji. &quot;Neele Neele Ambar Par&quot;, brilliantly performed by Kishore Kumar, is the most memorable, and it is quite nostalgic for me.

Raj Kapoor has been the immortal simpleton of Bollywood cinema whose performance in simpleton-type roles left indelible imprint on the hearts of his admirers. Today I am reviewing a four decades old entertaining movie whose hero is a simpleton. However this role has not been played by Raj Kapoor but his son - Randhir Kapoor. This movie is Raampur Ka Lakshman (1972).\n\nBased on the hackneyed &apos;lost and found&apos; formula of Bollywood movies, the story of Raampur Ka Lakshman (Lakshman of Raampur) starts with the separation of the members of a family containing two brothers - Ram and Lakshman and their parents. The hero of this movie is the younger brother - Lakshman (Randhir Kapoor) who happens to be with his father who migrates from the city to a village - Raampur and starts working and living with his benevolent friend who has a son - Prakash (Ramesh Deo). Upon growing-up, Prakash moves to the city to earn a living whereas Lakshman continues to live with his father only, winning hearts of the people with his simpleton type personality and mannerisms as well as his benevolent approach. Lakshman misses his lost mother and elder brother - Ram very much being unaware of the fact that his brother was taken away by a criminal after his separation from the family.\n\nWhen there is no letter from Prakash or any information about him for more than two months, the fathers of Lakshman and Prakash get worried about him. Lakshman consoles them and moves to the city, assuring them that he will locate Prakash in the city and bring him back to the village. In the city, on one hand,Lakshman happens to come across Rekha (Rekha), the daughter of the mayor of the city, as well as his mother (Sulochana) who works in her house; on the other, he is shocked to know that Prakash has been arrested by the police under the charge of a murder and now being tried in the court. Prakash tells Lakshman that he is innocent. Now Lakshman starts searching the real murderer to get Prakash released. A sophisticated criminal - Kumar (Shatrughan Sinha) seems to be associated with the murder. Lakshman crosses paths with Kumar on a number of times not just on account of his quest for the murderer but also the fact that Kumar is his rival for the love of Rekha. As you can guess, after several interesting incidents, Lakshman is able to get Prakash released by exposing the real murderer. The broken family also gets united with Lakshman having both his parents now but not his lost brother - Ram. Why ? The ending scene answers this question in a touching as well as philosophical manner.\n\nThis screenplay of this story has been written quite skilfully and presented also very well on the screen by the director - Manmohan Desaai who was a master in making masala flicks. The movie is very entertaining. Lakshman&apos;s innocent gestures, talks and activities prove to be heart-winning on one hand whereas the frequent twists and turns in the narrative keep the spectator hooked on the other. It is a complete Paisa Vasool (value for money) movie. The murder mystery is not great because it remains more or less known to the audience as to who is going to turn out as the real murderer. Still the narrative keeps the audience glued to the screen because the entertainment value of the movie is not on account of the murder mystery but on account of the character of Lakshman and his gimmicks. Optimal doses of parent-child affection, sentiments, romance, action and comedy are also there for the audience.\n\nThe highlight of Raampur Ka Lakshman is the performance of Randhir Kapoor in the title role. He has nowhere copied his legendary father and developed his own style. His dialog - Sab Raamji Ki Maaya Hai gets repeated throughout the movie (till the very end) but nowhere vexes. And such movies furnish a reason to understand why Randhir Kapoor was quite a popular hero of the seventies. The thing which is not understandable is his abrupt vanishing from the screen during the eighties. It&apos;s his marvellous performance as Lakshman which has made this movie a winner all the way. He has delivered amazing performance on the title track - Raampur Ka Baasi Hoon Main Lakshman Mera Naam for which credit should be given to the choreographer also. Prior to Amitabh Bachchan, Rekha had made a popular pair with Randhir Kapoor only during the seventies with an admirable on-screen chemistry between them. Herself alongwith Shatrughan Sinha and all others has done satisfactorily.\n\nTechnically, this formula-studded movie is up to the mark with the length also being in order. Music by R.D. Burman contains hummable (and hence popular) compositions viz. the title track, Goom Hai Kisi Ke Pyaar Mein Dil Subah-o-Shaam, Pyaar Ka Samay Kam Hai Jahaan, Kaahe Apno Ke Kaam Nahin Aaye, Albela Re Ruk Jaana, Saanvla Rang Hai Mera etc. Among these Pyaar Ka Samay Kam Hai Jahaan is a song which echoes my thoughts (when the time to love is insufficient, how are the people able to spare time for fighting ?). The meaningful lyrics of these songs have been written by Majrooh Sultaanpuri.\n\nRaampur Ka Lakshman was a commercial hit which gave a boost to the career of Randhir Kapoor. It&apos;s a treat for his admirers and bears good repeat value. If you want a wholesome entertainment, then please do watch this movie and sing with its simpleton hero - Raampur Ka Baasi Hoon Main Lakshman Mera Naam, Seedhi-Saadi Boli Meri Seedha-Saada Kaam ..."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama"",""Family""]","""1972-07-26""","""character name in title""","""2H18M""",50.0

Abhinetri is one such film, but surprisingly it is not cheeky like most of its counterparts. The screenplay ensures that we get what we paid forentertainment.\n\nKrishna Kumar (Prabhudeva) is a 34 year old working in a advertising agency in Mumbai. He is desperate to shed his single status and get married to any girl as long as she is modern and has the right figure. As luck would have it a dying grandmother gets him married to a village girl Devi (Tamannah). Krishna despises Devi and keeps his marriage a secret from his colleagues. One day, he changes his mind and takes her to an award function sponsored by his company and Devi undergoes a dramatic transformation. She becomes a different woman, wears minis, dances, speaks flawless English and flirts around. Back home, she becomes the village girl, wears sari, speaks nothing but telugu and does not remember that she has been out. Krishna soon finds out through his neighbors that an aspiring actress called Ruby killed herself in the very house he is staying. It is clear Devi is possessed by Ruby. Ruby makes a deal with Krishna, he should let her use Devi&apos;s body to fulfill her starry ambitions and she would leave him and Devi alone. Krishna reluctantly agrees with a promise that Ruby should leave Devi&apos;s body the moment the first film is released.Ruby agrees, but soon we learn that she has other plans..\n\nTamannah is spot on with both the characters, she effectively changes her body language for both the characters. The scenes where she threatens Prabhudeva and her dance sequence at the award show showcase her acting abilities which has surprisingly evolved over a decade.

Upon arrival, they decide to stay there at a Public Rooming House, which also happens to hou..."",""","""Jangal Mein Mangal (merrymaking in a forest or to be exact, a deserted place) is an entertaining movie which is an underrated and forgotten entertainer of the seventies.\n\nJangal Mein Mangal (1972) is a movie set completely in a forest (practically at Periyaar wildlife sanctuary, Thekkadi, Kerala) where two different groups of students reach a common Govt. guest house. One group contains all male students led by a strict disciplinarian - (retd.) Colonel M.K. Das (Pran) and the other one contains all female students led by equally strict disciplinarian - Professor Laxmi (Sonia Saahni). Quite naturally, romantic and comic encounters are there between the two groups as well as between their male-female leader duo. But the rom-com is intermixed with a crime-thriller also containing smuggling and murder tracks. After losing one beloved member from each group, the male-female groups are able to unmask the culprits.\n\nJangal Mein Mangal starts very interestingly with animation pictures alongwith which the credits appear on the screen. And the entertainment starts immediately after the credits end, with the entry of the caretaker of the Govt. guest house (Paintal) who welcomes the female group. Promptly thereafter the female group comes across the male group and the colourful interactions take the viewer into their grip.\n\nSince there are two groups of students shown, the movie contains a plethora of characters. Pran is all-pervasive, for quite surprisingly and interestingly, he has been given a double role. Alongwith the leader of the male group - Colonel M.K. Das, he has played the role of a student in his group too, named Raghu. Though young romantic pair of Kiran Kumar and Reena Roy is there, in my opinion, the script is the hero in this movie and not any character. There are many twists and turns in the movie which does not bore the viewer at any place. The horror, suspense and thrill has been kept intact for the ending reels and the major part of the movie has been dedicated to the rom-com, containing teasings, games and songs. The scene in which love sprouts between Colonel Das and Professor Laxmi tickles all the romantic hearts.\n\nOn the flip side, the villains seem to be outdated and over the top. Some characters are just like caricatures and some sequences (especially the sequence of the boys disguising themselves as girls and mingling with the girls) are not reliable. However since they serve the purpose of comedy, the director can be excused for them. Overall, the direction of Rajendra Bhatia is strictly okay and the script seems to be better than the direction. The murders in the final reels seem to be unnecessarily imposed on the story and they could have been avoided. The revelation of the identity of the murderer (who has been shown as scaring the forest-guests by masquerading as a ghost) does not spring any surprise which is the weakness of the direction.\n\nShankar-Jaikishan with the help of amusing lyrics of Hasrat and Neeraj, have composed hilarious music for the movie which is in perfect sync with the mood of the movie. Kishore&apos;s romantic song - Tum Kitni Khoobsurat Ho, Ye Mere Dil Se Poochho is definitely the best song of the album. However Aye Baag Ki Kaliyon Sharam Karo &amp; Aawaara Bhanwaron Sharam Karo are a treat to watch on the screen. Other songs are also good. I personally like Kal Ki Na Karo Baat sung by Kishore Da very much.\n\nPran has got the maximum footage in his double role and this villain of yesteryears has excelled like anything. He has won the audience&apos;s heart with two different kinds of performances in two entirely different roles - one of an old man and one of a young man. The complete youth brigade of the movie (Kiran Kumar, Narendra Nath, Reena Roy, Meena T., Jayshree T. and likewise) alongwith Sonia Saahni have done pretty well. Paintal is also good. Meena Roy (played the role of a nun accompanying the girls&apos; group), Chandrashekhar and Bharat Kapoor have also done satisfactorily. The baddies are disappointing. However a legendary actor like Balraj Saahni has been wasted in the role of an imprisoned Christian priest who is also the father of the nun.\n\nJangal Mein Mangal is a long forgotten movie which provides wholesome entertainment in the style of Bollywood during the seventies. It&apos;s a spicy masala flick which is a treat for a typical Bollywood movie viewer. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to all the entertainment-seekers. Come on, join the characters of the movie in Jangal (forest) and go for Mangal (enjoyment) with them.""},""aggregateRating""","[""Adventure"",""Romance""]","""1972-12-27""","""student,strict teacher,jungle,ghost,conspiracy""","""2H20M""",50.0

It destroyed the secular character of the Kashmir valley and Kashmiriyat suffered an irreparable hurt. That spark has now developed into a wildfire which seems to be beyond anybody&apos;s control. The intention of Pakistan was to convert the valley into a uni-religious place and then start its hue and cry for its secession on the same religious ground on which it itself had been created on 14.08.1947.

How the three protagonists struggle to raise the voice of the downtrodden and terrorized innocent Pandits is the remaining story which establishes in the end that terrorism has no religion and a misguided Muslim Kashmiri youth like Shaukat may also realize it but only after paying the huge cost in the form of the honour of his sister and his own life in the hands of the Pakistani terrorists.\n\nBeing a Kashmiri Pandit himself, director Ashok Pandit has made the movie with utmost sincerity and honesty. However I consider it his big mistake to direct the movie himself. Given the sensitive and the laudable story, he should have hired the services of some seasoned director of Bollywood to do justice to it and make a hard-hitting, yet touching movie, soaked with humanity. But his inexperience has let him (and the audience) down. The movie is not that impressive as it should have been. However his toil is to be appreciated. He has quite realistically highlighted the painful fact of the poor treatment meted out to the Pandits in the relevant camps at Delhi etc. Which was nothing short of insult to injury for those innocents.\n\nTechnically the movie is just ok. Cinematographer has captured the snowy beauty of Kashmir quite ably. The biggest asset of the movie is the highly melodious music of Nadeem Shravan with the meaningful and beautiful lyrics of Sameer for songs like Ye To Kashmir Hai Iski Fiza Ka Kya Kehna, Aye Sanam Kuja Beri, Main Ladki Kashmir Ki and Tum Dua Karo which have been sung by singers like Udit Narayan, Kavita Krishnamurthy, Sapna Mukherjee, Sonu Nigam, Kumar Sanu and Nirja Pandit; alongwith the Qawwaali of Sabari Brothers - Sahaara Chaahiye. However the best song of this movie is Aao Jannat Mein Jahannum Ka Nazaara Dekho which has been jointly sung by Kumar Sanu, Mohd Aziz, Nirja Pandit, Shreya Ghoshal, Sonu Nigam, Udit Narayan etc. No music lover should miss this extra-ordinary music album.\n\nPerformance wise talking, the newcomer girl Sheen in the title role, disappoints. Tarun Arora is so-so. The knock-out performances have come from Raj Babbar as Pandit Amarnath and Anoop Soni as Shaukat. Both have acted with utmost naturalness.\n\nI recommend this movie to all the secularists and humanists in India as well as abroad and appeal to my Muslim brethren and sisters to support the cause of the Kashmiri Pandits who have been forced to live like refugees in their own country. Due to the disgusting vote bank politics in India, no strong voices are heard to sympathize with this pain-stricken community. Nothing appears to be done to heal their wounds. In my clear and unbiased opinion, peace can never return to Kashmir unless the Pandits are rehabilitated in their homeland and the secular character of Kashmir is restored. After driving out more than three lakh Pandits from the valley, the secessionist forces have diverted their guns towards the Sikh community now. My straightforward question is - if non-Muslims cannot live in Kashmir with peace and dignity, does secular India really need that Kashmir ?"",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Drama""]","""2004-05-07""","""kashmiri pandit,kashmir,genocide,exodus,one word title""", ,18.0

Kavita later finds out that it was not Aru..."",""","""Prem Patra (1962) is a movie produced and directed by the legendary film director Bimal Roy. This beautiful movie is an emotional drama containing many twists and keeps the viewer engrossed for more than two and a half hours. It&apos;s one of the lesser known movie of Bimal Da but renders a heart-soothing experience to the viewers.\n\nPrem Patra (love letter) starts with the life in a medical college where Arun (Shashi Kapoor) is undergoing his MBBS course. A very talented youth Arun is all set to get a scholarship to pursue higher studies abroad when a fake love letter written by someone in his name to Kavita (Saadhana) shatters his dream to become a big doctor. Circumstances force him to accept an offer made to him to marry an illiterate girl Taara (Seema) who comes from a rich family and get the sponsorship for his studies in return. Arun goes abroad where he keeps on getting letters from his betrothed Taara. These letters are actually not written by Taara but by Kavita, Taara&apos;s friend and the girl who was at the nucleus of the love letter controversy that changed Arun&apos;s life forever. However these love-soaked letters make Arun falling madly in love with his would-be wife.\n\nWhile doing some experiment while pursuing his medical course abroad, Arun happens to meet an accident and loses his eyesight. Now blind Arun comes to the house of his would be in-laws (he is actually an orphan) and starts waiting for the operation of his eyes as planned by the doctors. Meantime is adequately taken care of by a girl who considers serving him as her biggest duty. He is under an impression that this girl is his betrothed Taara. However it&apos;s not Taara who has already fallen in love with another guy Subhaash (Sudhir). It&apos;s Kavita who considers herself as responsible for spoiling the career of Arun. Blind Arun is never able to forgive Kavita who had complained against him to the college administration for that &apos;love letter&apos; without trying to ascertain the truth. And now he is being served like a devoted nurse (and also a devoted sweetheart or wife) as Kavita&apos;s penitence for that. The movie ends on a happy note.\n\nThis sentimental story of Prem Patra written by Nitin Bhattacharya is very good and emotionally appeals to the audience when comes on the screen but the lengthy side tracks (including a comedy track) unnecessarily inserted block the flow of the main story. This digression irritates because the main track itself is very interesting and engaging for the viewer. The side stories have added avoidable extra footage to the movie which could have been shorter, crispier and taut without them. The movie is entertaining and impressive all the same. The spectator finds himself as flowing with the story and effortlessly falls in love with the lead pair.\n\nThere are two very big plus points of this charming black and white movie. The first one is performances. Both Shashi Kapoor and Saadhana were in the initial years of their careers at the time of this movie and they have delivered lovely performances. They are not style icons here as they became in later years. They are simple, sober and straight out of real life instead. All others including Parveen Chaudhary playing Ratna who is the daughter of Arun&apos;s guardian and is in love with him; are also perfect in their respective places.\n\nThe second one is music. Salil Chaudhary has come up with one of his best musical scores with the help of the lyrics of Rajinder Krishan. Lata Mangeshkar and Talat Mahmood have sung two very beautiful, delicate and touching duets - 1. Ye Mere Andhere Ujaale Na Hote Agar Tum Na Aate Meri Zindagi Mein. 2. Saawan Ki Raaton Mein Aisa Bhi Hota Hai. Other songs - Ab Aur Na Kuchh Bhi Yaad Raha, Khush Ho Rahe The Pehle Thukra Ke Zindagi Ko, Do Ankhiyaan Jhuki Jhuki Si etc. are also admirable.\n\nTechnically this black and white movie is good. However the editor could have done it a favour by shortening its length. It&apos;s not a lavish movie. It has a very simple milieu with the post-interval session mostly taking place in a rural setting.\n\nPrem Patra is not among the best of Bimal Da&apos;s works. This simple movie is lovable nevertheless and nobody will regret after watching it. I wholeheartedly recommend it mainly to those who are fond of watching golden oldies."",""reviewRating""", , , ,"""2H37M""",60.0

Look at films like Hum Saath Saath Hain, Dil to Pagal Hai, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. Haven&apos;t the subjects they been based on been repeated before? So why complain about Sukh when even directors like Yash Chopra, Karan Johar have picked themes that have been before? Beats me.\n\nAnyway, what could have help this film is a better director. Govinda&apos;s brother Kirti Kumar (actual name Kirti Ahuja) directed this film and he has not been able to capture the magic he had in Hatya. Hatya remains his best film and this film doesn&apos;t change that. Unfortunately he fails as the director to infuse some life in the script.\n\nGovinda does a good job. At least he has tried something different and to be fair he does do a good job. There is a certain honesty and sincerity about his performance especially towards the end. The only thing i say is he should get himself into shape. A fitter Govinda is much better even if the films are not doing well.\n\nPreeti Jaganani is o.k, she looked comfortable opposite Govinda despite the age difference. They do share good chemistry and i hope they star together in better films and with Govinda trimmed down. Chunky Pandey isn&apos;t that bad but the chemistry and spark between him and Govinda is not as great as it was in Aankhen. Aarti from my view wasn&apos;t great but not bad either, i didn&apos;t really have any complaints of her character or performance.\n\nThe film shows how sometimes the simplest of men can become greedy for money in today&apos;s world and how trust and love is important for a successful marriage.\n\nI don&apos;t think the film isn&apos;t really a film for teenagers or young adults. It is more aimed at the elderly and couples in their 30s and mid to late 20s from my view but i might be wrong.\n\nThe film is worth a watch for Govinda and the message it is portraying. A decent attempt by Govinda but direction would have made it even better.\n\nMy Rating- 6/10"",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy"",""Family"",""Romance""]","""2005-06-17""","{""total"":0", ,17.0

On being confronted by his mother, he decides to find a job and lands one in Mumbai, where he continues wooing Asha (Nutan). Kishore&apos;s father and his friend were murdered by a notorious Anantram who now wears a mask to hide his true identity and continues manufacturing spurious medicines and also passes as Nutan&apos;s uncle. The firm employing Kishore is run by Anantram and his two henchmen-Sevakram and Bihari. Anantram goes to murder Kishore in the hospital but drops his monocle which makes Iftekhar suspicious-he manages to take Anantram&apos;s fingerprints on SohanLal&apos;s wallet and figures out the truth. What follows is a dramatic air-borne sequence where Anantram is beaten by Kishore and shot by Nutan. Kishore manages to land the aeroplane after the pilots lose their consciousness...and as they say all&apos;s well that ends well.\n\nThe first half of the movie is slow and would have been a drag but for the presence of the inimitable Kishore Kumar. The director makes up for the first half in the latter half of the movie as the events unfold quickly before the story reaches its climax. One also gets to listen to some very memorable songs-a water ballet &quot;ye bahar ye sama, ye jhoomti jawaniyan&quot; and then &quot;hum to mohabbat karega..&quot; followed by &quot;CAT..&quot; showing Kishore doing his hilarious earth-shaking moves and then the beautiful duet &quot;ye ratein ye mausam..&quot; \n\nIts like going back in time...only by 49 years and a sad realization that none of the actors who played a pivotal role in the movie are alive but their memory lingers on (other than the singer Asha Bhonsle) (Sanjeev Logani ", , , , ,64.0

The female leads are played by Vidya Sinha and Shabana Azmi, who do their roles well but the movie centers around Rajesh Khanna and the effect predictions can have. Ultimately predictions are proved wrong and prayer and Karm rule. A good movie made with good intentions and very well presented. The weak link is average music by R D Burman or may be the director did not create situations for a nice song.

Thakur, a..."",""","""I have a great regard for the Bollywood film director of the sixties, seventies and early eighties - Raghunath Jhaalani. He has not been a high profile or very famous film director. But this underrated film director has directed very impressive and entertaining movies viz. Aaya Saawan Jhoom Ke (1969), Anamika (1973), Uljhan (1975), Be-reham (1980) etc. Today I am reviewing a romantic social drama directed by him on a novel theme (considering the trend going on in Bollywood those days). It&apos;s Badaltay Rishtay (1978) starring Jeetendra, Rishi Kapoor and Reena Roy.\n\nBadaltay Rishtay (changing relations) has taken up two very important issues from the viewpoint of Indian society. Both have been relevant since ages, were relevant at the time of the release of this movie more than three decades back and they are relevant even today.\n\nThe first one is a girl&apos;s devotion after she is married to someone other than the person she has been in love with. Right from the movies of the black and white era to Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam in 1999, the thing underscored is once the girl is married, she had better respect the wedlock and the sanctity of the husband-wife relationship (unless, of course, her husband is a bad person). Continuing to love her ex-beau and longing to live with him even after getting married to someone, is not desirable for the Indian girls. I appreciate this view with the addition that it is equally applicable to the boys too. Nothing is permanent in this world, then why should we expect the relations to be the same throughout the life when enough water might have flown in the river ? The second one is the superstitions prevalent in the Indian society, especially among the Indian women. There is little doubt that even the highly educated Indians have been utterly superstitious, believing in illogical things and believing in what the astrologers foretell about them. The situation is not very bright in this regard even today. Especially the Indian females have been vulnerable to the talks of the astrologers making them apprehensive of their future or the future of their beloveds.\n\nThe story of Badaltay Rishtay covers both the abovesaid issues. It&apos;s a story based on triangular relationship and set in Simla. Savitri (Reena Roy) loves Manohar (Rishi Kapoor) but a professor of astrology (A.K. Hangal) tells her that once she gets married, her husband will die within 40 days of her marriage. The additional thing told to her is that if she marries again, her second marriage will be a long-lasting and joyful one. Believing it, she marries Saagar (Jeetendra) who proposes her. Now Savitri starts counting the 40 days period after which she is supposed to become a widow and free to marry Manohar, her first love. Here comes the twist in the tale.\n\nManohar approaches the post-marriage home of Savitri and not only befriends her husband - Saagar but also wins the confidence of her in-laws. However Savitri is shocked like anything when he reveals his hitherto covered face which is of a greedy blackmailer who does not want her love but the money of her rich husband. He not only attempts on Saagar&apos;s life but also threatens Savitri to trap her unmarried sister-in-law in his fake love if she refuses to obey him. These developments set up a very interesting climax in which Saagar comes to know of the facts on the 40th day of their marriage (which, according to the astrologer&apos;s forecast, is going to be the last day of his life). The ending scene of the movie is again twisty and leaves a long-lasting impact on the viewers.\n\nBoth the messages of the movie - start life afresh with the wedding moment leaving your past behind as well as not to rely the forecasts blindly - are laudable and impressively conveyed. The screenplay has been skillfully written and aptly directed.\n\nAmong the three main protagonists, Rishi Kapoor takes the cake both in looks as well as acting performance. This was the first role of his career containing grey shades and he has delivered a stunning performance. He looks quite charming in the initial reels and equally hateable in the later reels. Jeetendra and Reena Roy are just okay. The supporting cast has done well.\n\nHeart-winning music composed by Laxmikant Pyarelal is the icing on the cake with the beautiful lyrics coming from the pen of Anjaan. Three songs are especially mentionable - Meri Saanson Ko Jo Mehka Rahi Hai Ye Pehle Pyar Ki Khushboo, Woh Woh Na Rahe Jinke Liye Hum The Beqaraar and the title track - Na Jaane Kaise Pal Mein Badal Jaate Hain Ye Duniya Ke Badalte Rishte. Singers like Rafi, Kishore, Mahendra Kapoor, Lata and Suman Kalyanpur have given their voices for the various songs.\n\nTechnically the movie is up to the mark. The cinematographer has captured the beauty of Simla quite proficiently. The movie is not unduly long also. In fact, romance, comedy, music, emotions, suspense; all the ingredients of an entertaining movie have been intermixed in such a way that the length is not at all felt by the watcher.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this forgotten social drama of the seventies to all the movie buffs. Just start watching this movie and then the director won&apos;t allow you to leave the drama in-between and keep you stick to your seat till the finish.\n\nMy final words - it&apos;s said that change is the only permanent thing in the world. It&apos;s true to a great extent. Male-female relations do change with the changes arriving in the lives of the people involved and if the change is desirable, let it occur.

A young man named Kumar also attends at this lodge, claiming to be the owner, and asking the caretaker,..."",""","""The decade of the sixties witnessed many Bollywood potboilers which lacked any solid story but made in such a way blending melodious songs, good locations and charming actors in the otherwise routine script that they proved to be quite entertaining for the audience and hence quite naturally, scored on the box office. One such movie is Mere Sanam (1965).\n\nMere Sanam (my sweetheart) is the love story of Neena (Asha Parekh) and Kumar (Biswajeet) with Shyam (Pran) playing the role of the villain and Kamini (Mumtaaz) being his accomplice in his evil designs. The story has been woven like this that Neena, her female friends and her mother reach a holiday spot and find accommodation in a lodge whose owner is Kumar but the caretaker is Shyam. Shyam obliges the ladies by allowing them to stay there but Kumar arrives at the lodge and asks Shyam to remove those &apos;intruders&apos; from there. Now Shyam who is actually a baddie (involved in illegal opium trade also), tells different false stories to the female-group on one hand and Kumar on the other. As usual in our Hindi movies, eventually Kumar and Neena fall in love but Shyam himself wants to marry Neena to usurp her wealth (she is actually the daughter of a rich man who had got separated from her mother and herself long back). He creates misunderstandings between them with the help of Kamini but the things take such a turn that Kamini gets murdered in the hands of Shyam&apos;s man with Kumar being trapped in it. After a few more twists in the tale, the lovers reunite and the villain is caught by the law.\n\nThe first part of the story has been taken from the Hollywood movie - Come September (1961). I have found that this idea has been adapted (with some changes) in a couple of other Bollywood movies too. Anyway, the script has been written quite interestingly as per the taste of the Indian audience.The the interest of the viewer has been maintained till the interval through rom-com and post-interval through the activities and plans of the villain. The beautiful locations of Kashmir and the melodious songs have helped the otherwise not-so-great screenplay. The thing is, you enjoy whatever comes on the screen and that&apos;s the only important thing for a film&apos;s success.\n\nBiswajeet and Asha Parekh made a charming pair and their on-screen romance is damn good. However, considering the nitty-gritty of the script, Shammi Kapoor would have been a better choice for the role of the hero. The supporting cast is routine. Rajendra Nath as the comedian, Pran as the villain and Mumtaaz as the vamp fit the bill of their respective roles. No performance is great. No performance is bad either. If at all, someone is to be mentioned specially for her performance, it&apos;s Mumtaaz whose vampish act which also contains the chartbuster song of Asha Bhonsle - Ye Hai Reshmi Zulfon Ka Andhera Na Ghabraaiye leaves its imprint on the mind of the spectator.\n\nTechnically, the movie is up-to-the-mark. The cinematographer has captured the beauty of Kashmir very well. Length is according to the norms of that period and since there is no boredom and the well-known formulae of romance, comedy, sentiments and thrill have been blended well, the length of the movie appears to be appropriate. Editor has done his job well. Ditto for the art director. Background score is also OK. The movie has a high production value.\n\nThe biggest strength of the movie is undoubtedly the memorable music composed by O.P. Nayyar. Considering his aversion for Lata Mangeshkar, he has got the female songs sung by Asha Bhonsle only. Ye Hai Reshmi Zulfon Ka Andhera Na Ghabraaiye, Jaaiye Aap Kahaan Jaayenge, Roka Kai Baar Maine Dil Ki Umang Ko etc. are quite ear-soothing in Asha&apos;s enchanting voice. However the movie boasts of Mohammed Rafi&apos;s memorable songs also viz. Humdum Mere Maan Bhi Jaao Kehna Mere Pyar Ka, Huye Hain Tum Pe Aashiq Hum Bura Maano Bhala Maano, Tukde Hain Mere Dil Ke Aye Yaar Tere Aansoo and above all, Pukaarta Chala Hoon Main Gali Gali Bahaar Ki. If for nothing else, this movie can be watched repeatedly for the songs only.\n\nMere Sanam is a formula-based regular Hindi movie and there is nothing great about it. However it has a high entertainment value and if watch it to get a nice timepass, it will certainly not disappoint you."",""reviewRating""","[""Musical"",""Romance""]","""1965-11-13""","""love,flirting,kashmir,seductress,hotel""","""2H47M""",57.0

Anyway, Gulshan Grover does a good job of portraying the main villain &quot;Yamraaj&quot;.

Years later, Birju becomes a successful singer and returns to seek his approval."",""","""Saawan is the rainy month in India and the Indian culture has a lot to relate with Saawan - enthusiasm, prosperity, happiness and of course, love and romance ! Young hearts long for Saawan to come and when it comes, they want the company of their beloveds. Today I am reviewing a musical blockbuster from the prestigious Rajshri banner of bollywood which was released in 1979 but still remembered for its great music and touching story.\n\nSaawan Ko Aane Do is the love story of Chandrika (Zarina Wahab), the city-educated daughter of the village landlord (Amrish Puri) and Birju (Arun Govil), the simple and naive singer whose abundant talent is hidden in the village like a diamond lying in the dust. Like always, the wall of wealth and status stands between the hearts and Birju, humiliated by Chandrika&apos;s father, moves to the city to do something worthwhile in his life. Birju is helped by Geetanjali (Rita Bhaduri) in the city and with a bit of luck, success starts kissing his feet. Despite becoming a renowned singer, he cannot make Chandrika&apos;s father agree to their marriage because his father&apos;s false pride is not ready to bow down. In a court case, Chandrika&apos;s father loses all his wealth and Chandrika has to take a teaching job in the village school. How the lovers get reunited in the ending scene with the song - Teri Tasveer Ko Seene Se Laga Rakha Hai - is a treat to see for the emotional viewers.\n\nRajshri movies are known for their simplicity and director Kanak Mishra has left no stone unturned in maintaining the Rajshri tradition with finesse. The story moves ahead with portrayal of simple village life in India and songs keep on coming like precious gems with the twists in the narrative. Despite the predictable plot, the viewer is glued to the screen because everything seems so lovable and touching that it is difficult to leave this movie in between. The success of Birju in the city looks like a fairytale and may not sound real to many but the complete storyline and treatment is so lovely and heart-soothing, that we overlook this fact considering it the cinematic liberty taken by the writer to take the story to the desired climax.\n\nI had seen this movie long back but I still remember the scene in which the lovers (Arun and Zareena) keep on looking at each other&apos;s faces without uttering a single word. That&apos;s the true love which is to be felt and not to be described or discussed. The movie is studded with delicate feelings and emotions and the narrative flows the viewer away with it. Anybody putting a premium on love, would like to be lost in this movie.\n\nArun and Zareena have made a great pair in this movie. I consider both these actors as excellent actors despite the moderate success they got in their respective acting careers. The innocence on their faces (especially in the first half of the movie) proves that they only were the perfect choice for the roles assigned. Amrish Puri got the recognition for his talent quite late but anybody who liked his performance in Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge (1995) should see this movie also in which he has done a brilliant job. The cousin of Jaya Bhaduri, Rita Bhaduri did not get meaty roles in her career matching her talent. Saawan Ko Aane Do showcases her talent in the significant supporting role. All others have done justice to their characters according to the demand of their roles in the movie.\n\nSaawan Ko Aane Do is an unforgettable musical journey. It has ten songs. All ten are real gems from the ocean of bollywood music. The lyrics have been written by . Music director Rajkamal has composed the music of a lifetime for the songs. I am giving the list of all ten songs here (the last one is my personal favourite) ", , , ,"""2H33M""",43.0

While Ashok takes to crime and dishonesty, Kishore is honest to a fault. When Kishore finds that his dad (Rajan Mehra) has be..."",""","""I firmly believe that man is a product of his experiences, his circumstances and his environment. A person cannot give back to the society anything different from what the society has given to him / her. You pay back to the life only what you gain from it. The coin is bound to be the same in which the repayment takes place. Whenever the issue of nature versus nurture comes before me, I underscore that it&apos;s nurture which finally matters and not the genes. Let a person go through good fostering, positive experiences and the company of nice ones and he / she will become a good man (or woman) and vice versa will follow if he / she goes through the contrary. Sachaai (1969) corroborates this thinking of mine through the story of two friends having different lines of thinking and philosophies for life.\n\nSachaai or Sachchaai (truth) tells the tale of two close friends - Ashok (Shammi Kapoor) and Kishore (Sanjeev Kumar) who are having their education together. Ashok believes in the philosophy of eat, drink and be merry without giving a damn for moral values. Money should come to enjoy life by whatever way possible, is his thinking. On the other hand, Kishore is an idealist who believes in ethics and strictly against earning through unfair means. After their college life, these two friends decide to go their own ways in life and meet after three years to check whose philosophy turns out to be the correct one.\n\nAshok goes ahead according to his immoral line of thinking but a painful incident proves to be an eye-opener for him and he realizes that he was wrong for all these years. He now comes to understand the significance of ethics and virtues of life. His good fortune brings him into contact with Shobha (Saadhana) and Shobha&apos;s pure love does not allow him to pick the wrong path anymore. His experiences consisting of both tears and smiles cleanse his heart. He joins police force and starts performing his duty to catch the criminals with utmost diligence and honesty.\n\nKishore, on the other hand, is shocked through his negative experiences and hardships. Circumstances bring him into the company of baddies and outlaws and the erstwhile man of principles and moral values is compelled by life to enter the world he had never thought of entering even in the wildest of his dreams in his student life. The innocent, clean-heart youth graduates to a notorious criminal known as Baaghi Sitaara in the world of crime and investigation. Ashok, now Inspector Ashok, is assigned the duty to catch Baaghi Sitaara by his department and Kishore alias Baaghi Sitaara comes to know that an honest and efficient police inspector is now on his trail. Being unaware of each other&apos;s present identity, the separated college friends meet after a long gap of three years according to the old promise. What happens thereafter is the climax of this story.\n\nSachaai is a formula-based potboiler and the filmmaker has not tried to make a great movie. But the theme itself is so good that by default and due to the admirable performances of both the protagonists, the movie has turned out to be something that cannot be termed as ordinary. The script follows the oft-beaten path but still it manages to pull off not only as an entertaining flick but also a message-rendering impressive tale. The film is interesting right from the start to the finish and the regular twists appearing in the narrative do not allow the viewer to get bored even for a minute.\n\nPerformances have lifted the screenplay further. Shammi Kapoor and Sanjeev Kumar are the pillars of the movie and both of them have performed exceedingly well, rendering reliability to their roles. When this movie was made, Shammi Kapoor was at the peak of his career as the leading man in the movies whereas Sanjeev Kumar was fast carving a niche for himself by proving his versatility in acting. However both of them have complimented pretty well on the screen and made the movie worth watching more than once. Gorgeous Saadhana has also done her part well. The supporting cast is also well in place. Johnny Walker has done good comedy.\n\nShankar-Jaikishan&apos;s music is admirable. Rajender Krishan has penned the beautiful lyrics. The popular romantic duet of Rafi and Asha - Sau Baras Ki Zindagi Se Achchhe Hain Pyar Ke Do Chaar Din is the best song of the album. Asha&apos;s solos - More Sainyaan Pakade Baiyan and Beet Chali Haay Raam are also good. However situational and theme-linked songs like Aye Dost Mere Maine Duniya Dekhi Hai (a duet of Rafi and Manna Dey) and Mere Gunaah Maaf Kar (Rafi) are the songs which support and push the narrative.\n\nAll the technical aspects of the movie are in order. Length is also appropriate. As said earlier, the movie does not bore at any place and maintains the curiosity of the viewer throughout. While recommending this good movie unconditionally to all the movie buffs, I reiterate that the society should give such a positive treatment to the budding individual that he grows up into an ideal citizen because he can give back to the society only what he gets from it in the first place."",""reviewRating""", , , ,"""2H40M""",53.0

Balachander&apos;s Ek Nai Paheli is a beautiful film, both visually and story-wise. As you would expect from a Balachander film, it is visually a great picture to look at - the cinematography, the sets, the costume design, all demonstrate the high production values employed in the making of this film. The script, however, and the later development of the story, are not fully realised. The film narrates the love story of a young man with a woman who is a decade or two his senior, and sadly, the story is never really brave enough to dig into the complexity of this relationship, and everything stays quite on the surface. There is some nice dialogue and there&apos;s depth as well in the portrayal of the human relationship, but never to the extent of daring to be less polished and a little more real and matter-of-fact.\n\nHema Malini is beautiful, very retrained and impressively so, and Kamaal Hasaan is competent as an idealistic and stubborn young man, though at times over-expressive. The two seem to have a good working chemistry, but something is missing there as there is very little intimacy between the two; it&apos;s like a very good friendship which lacks, and perhaps is even mistaken as, real romance. Good support is provided by Raaj Kumar and the stunning Padmini Kolhapure. Ek Nai Paheli is a beautiful film in many ways, it is reminiscent of the old classics in its general feel and energy, in its music and culturally rich, elegant setting, but it could have been better if more effort had been made to depict the love story itself. An aesthetic delight, indeed, and well directed by K. Balachander, who could and should have pushed the envelope a little more."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama""]","""1984-06-29""","""love,singer,ex husband,widower,father son conflict""", ,38.0

After a tiring Friday,to chill myself out here came the Raj Kapoor starer Shriman Satyawadi which was released in 1960 which focuses on how truth has become an ugly word to this society.One more aspect about the movie is that,despite the movie being made 5 decades ago it still maintains connectivity with the viewer.Probably that&apos;s why Raj Kapoor&apos;s films have an immortal quality and his films still enchant many film lovers.\n\nThe film journeys on an honest guy who believes nothing can replace truth and ethics and those values will sometime or the other come in handy-Though the film has traces of Shree 420 in the honesty aspect,the other parts were quite different, well structured and enacted.30 minutes into the movie and you&apos;re sunk into Vijay&apos;s world and we forget the actor portraying it.That&apos;s called acting and that&apos;s class.Raj Kapoor&apos;s uncanny knack of managing comedy and emotions at once is real quality to be observed.Never do the characters make us feel they &apos;rent believable.

A gangster, Diwan, manages to procure this plan from corrupt military officials, and hides it in his safe along with other valuables. The police find out that the plans have been stolen by a &quot;Diwan&quot;, and start a manhunt for all Diwans in Bombay. When they come across the Diwan, they ask him to show them his valuables, which he agrees to do so. To his shock, he finds that he has been burgled. The police conclude that the thief is none other than Diwan&apos;s trusted man, Ajit. They have him arrested, but he refuses to divulge any information. Diwan recruits a man called Rocky to spring Ajit from prison, as well as find out where he has stashed the valuables. Rocky, who keeps on denying that he is indeed Rocky, agrees to do so for a large sum of money as his fee, to which Diwan agrees. Rocky&apos;s plan is to seduce cabaret dancer, Seema, who is the lover of the Jailer, and hence gain entry to the jail. When this fails, Rocky gets himself arrested and jailed in the same prison as Ajit. Upon his entry in the prison, is where the truth surfaces that the man they call Rocky is not Rocky at all but an impostor, who has agreed to be Rocky just to get the large fee. The real Rocky, who calls himself Kanhaiyalal, agrees to help the false Rocky escape from prison, along with Ajit, so that they can find the plans and hand them in to Diwan, and collect their fee. But fate has other plans for the false Rocky, as he is caught by another master criminal and gangster, Ranjeet, and held until he tells him about the whereabouts of the plans as well as the valuables.

The film is based on the written Ramayana, an epic tale of Lord Rama who is an avatar of Vishnu, the Preserver. His wife, Sita, is an avatar of Lakshmi, goddess of wealth. Sita traditionally has been considered the paragon of virtues for Hindu women. She is known for her dedication, self-sacrifice, courage, and purity.\n\nThe actor who plays Ram, Mahipal, was a well known star in 1961. However, Anita Guha, who portrays Sita, was virtually unknown until she starred in this movie. The movie was extremely popular, and she became famous throughout India.\n\nEven the DVD cover refers to the Ramayana as &quot;mythology.&quot; I think this stems from our Judeo-Christian culture, which regards our stories as religion, and the stories of other cultures as myth. (That&apos;s why we say Greek myths or Norse myths.) The Ramayan is based on Hindu religious tradition. It is not a myth to Hindus.\n\nWhat&apos;s interesting is that this religious story is full of colorful scenes, epic battles, romance, and tragedy. It&apos;s a truly fascinating account that includes a Monkey King and a demon among the characters.\n\nIn 1961 the film was probably state of the art for Indian cinema. However, the production values and acting style appear very old-fashioned almost 60 years later. What is not old-fashioned is the great music. Indian actors don&apos;t sing movie songs. These are dubbed by professional singers. Two songs in this movie are sung by Lata Mangeshkar, who is the most famous Indian film vocalist. I learned that these two songs are still popular today. (Believe it or not, we heard Lata in performance in Toronto in the 1980&apos;s. She&apos;s great.)\n\nThis isn&apos;t a film I can recommend casually to IMDb viewers. Some people will find it too old fashioned, too long, or both. Indian audiences probably will like it more than U.S. audiences. Still, it has its own niche in film history, and you might enjoy it.\n\nWe saw Ramayana on DVD, where it worked well. I suggest that you give it a try. If you don&apos;t like it, you can always hit eject."",""reviewRating""", , , ,"""3H3M""",61.0

There, she gets attracted to George, a volunteer, but is afraid to get close to him due to her condition."",""","""One of those sweet movies which, at the same time, also provoke you to think. The central theme of the movie is around an AIDS center which takes care of afflicted children and adults. It talks about living in the moment, in the present, today rather than worry about &apos;the might have beens&apos; or the future. The story is told very poignantly without being melodramatic or overtly emotional at any point. The acting from Nandita Das and Rajit Kapoor is first rate. Anupam Kher is OK - I don&apos;t think he gets into the skin of the character at all. I personally feel a Boman Irani or a Naseeruddin Shah might have done more justice to the character. Renuka Shahane is great in a cameo appearance.\n\nThe only reason I am going to give it a lowly 6 is because of the poor music and the over-acting by the children (seems so &apos;70s ish). The editing also could have been better as the scene transitions seem a little abrupt at times. Overall, the director seems to have good intentions and save for the few technical flaws, is definitely watchable."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama""]","""2003-01-03""","{""total"":0","""2H""",19.0

However, the film itself is a huge disappointment. It starts with an elderly woman looking for a possible suitor for her grandson. The condition is that the suitor will have to bear a male heir. It gave the impression that the film would deal with people&apos;s (society) preference for male child over a female. The film then shifts into a romantic movie about Waheeda Rehman&apos;s and Raj Kapoor&apos;s characters. Then it gets more serious as it becomes about a couple trying to make a living. From there it shifts to a comedy about the same couple fooling the grandmother.\n\nThe film lacks focus and coherence. The direction is very poor. The ending is horrendous and shows the film to be very misogynistic. The songs are too many. Although they are pleasant, they&apos;re not memorable. Personally, i only liked the title song.\n\nThe performances range from mediocre to bad. Raj Kapoor is pretty bad and he dances horribly. Lalita Pawar is pretty much the same as in all her films.

A very immature copy of &quot;Sliding Doors&quot; released in 1998, it simply offers nothing even close to exciting or thought provoking as compared to its original. In fact the only positive impact it can possibly make is to create enough curiosity in the viewers to watch its real source of inspiration, which no doubt was based on imaginative creative thinking.\n\nBut whenever such hugely inspired movies are presented before us, I really wonder that Do the writers and directors actually reveal what they are going to copy in their initial talks with the producers about the project or not? Do they really bring along the Original DVDs of the English movies in those meetings or they simply take the producers as granted. Whatever the case may be, the bitter truth is that Indian Film Industry is still working on the same rotten path of copying and we are still being served very amateurish kind of unofficial versions in the name of entertainment.\n\nDirector Partho Ghosh has earlier been associated with projects such as 100 DAYSand AGNISAKSHI which were also clear clones of their English hits. And he keeps following the same old trend in his EK SECOND too. However in his latest version he chooses a wrong movie to get inspired from as the subject is just not apt for the Indian viewers.\n\nThe story deals with a female character, whose life gets drastically affected, as she misses on to the tube-train by only one second. From the tube-station itself the narration divides the storyline into two imaginary parts. One part of the movie talks about the girl taking the train in time and then meeting another guy in the tube. Whereas the other part of the story deals with the girl missing the train and then catching her boyfriend at home in bed with another lady. Sounds interesting.yes it surely is, but sadly not in this below average copy of the real thing, as it completely ruins the innovative subject with its sub-standard treatment.\n\nIn few words, EK SECOND is one of those poorly made projects which luckily get to see the light of the theaters due to some reason. The movie seems to be long in the making with names such as Manisha Koirala, Jackie Shroff and Anand Raaj Anand. Many scenes in the film involving some new and uncomfortable actors are simply intolerable. Post intermission, each such new scene featuring the amateur actors forces you to move out of hall at once, which clearly indicates about the quality of the movie as a whole.\n\nFrankly speaking, I should not be taking more of your time writing about the performances, music, cinematography or direction in &quot;EK SECOND&quot;. If you really think it&apos;s based on an interesting concept, then you may watch &quot;Sliding Doors&quot; (which incidentally is also just an above average stuff only).\n\nYet, the only comment I can give here for the movie is, Let&apos;s move on to something better.\n\nRating ","[""Drama"",""Romance"",""Thriller""]","""2010-06-11""","""life""", ,12.0

They k..."",""","""During the last few years, I have watched quite a few Indian films and have enjoyed them very much. However, most these films were recent Tamil or Hindi films and so I recently decided to try some older films. Apart from the movies of Satyajit Ray (of which I&apos;ve seen quite a few), I really have had no idea what to expect. Also, because this is only my second Indian musical of the era, I cannot make any generalizations and have no idea if &quot;Dharti&quot; is good or bad relative to other Indian films of the day. I will just have to judge it on its own merits--for good or bad.\n\n&quot;Dharti&quot; begins in the fictional country of Basanpur. The Chief Minister is a cruel maniac who delights in killing his subjects and scheming. He also is more than willing to sell out his people to foreigners--not too surprising a theme considering the history of India. As for the King, he&apos;s weak and ineffectual--and afraid to confront the Chief Minister for his wicked ways.\n\nAt the same time Basanpur is being mismanaged, the young princess, Princess Chitralekha, is in Europe--oblivious to the problems in her nation. She meets a bright young Oxford graduate from her country, Bharat, but she doesn&apos;t want him to know she&apos;s a princess. The two fall in love and all looks great for them...until her father orders her home to marry the evil Chief Minister! Now here is where the film becomes insanely bad. On board the jet airplane, Bharat and Chitralekha have a run-in with one of the Chief Minister&apos;s lackeys. A fist fight ensues and the special effects for the plane are quiet stupid. In fact, they are the worst airplane effects ever in the history of cinema! The plane is obviously fake and a toy plane on a string would have been more realistic! As for inside the plane, during the fight a soft cushion hits a window and smashes it...on a Boeing 707!! Talk about a quality product. In fact, it&apos;s such a high quality product that there is no depressurization--none! No wind. Nothing! Then, inexplicably, the plane spins wildly and smashes into the ocean. Bharat and Chirtralekha are just fine--with no scars or loss of blood!!! It&apos;s a freakin&apos; airliner dropping out of the sky in mid-flight--and yet they are only slightly shaken up by the ordeal!! The badness of this scene makes the film worth seeing and ranks among the worst special effects in all the films I have reviewed--putting it on par with the UFOs in Ed Wood&apos;s &quot;Plan 9 From Outer Space&quot;.\n\nOnce they are back in Basanpus, Bharat becomes embroiled in the patriotic movement to oust the Chief Minister. Soon, many of his comrades are dead--killed by the evil Chief Minister&apos;s troops. But, throughout all this bloodshed, Bharat appears to be indestructible. Heck, he even manages to shoot down a helicopter with his rifle. He is some guy!! And, at his side is the princess--who has now joined with the rebels. From this point on, there are some assassination attempts (including one which MIGHT kill Bharat&apos;s own father, the Inspector General, in order to kill the Chief Minister!). And, ultimately, it comes down to a fight to the death between Bharat and the Chief Minister--a rousing finale, indeed.\n\nAs far as giving this film a numerical score, this is VERY tough. While the acting and plot were pretty good, some of the scenes (especially the airplane sequence) were simply horrible. In addition, since I haven&apos;t seen many other musical films from this era, it&apos;s hard to know how good or bad it is compared to them. For entertainment value, I&apos;d give this one a 6. If the airplane scene was not in the film, a 7 or 8.\n\nBy the way, for the more tender-hearted, there is a graphic bullfight scene early in the film--complete with blood and a dying bull. You might want to speed past this portion--especially since it isn&apos;t necessary to the plot. I sure wish this had not been in the film and am actually VERY surprised they included this. Not only is it unnecessary for the film but must have offended many Hindu audience members where the animal is considered sacred."",""reviewRating""", , , , ,52.0

I don&apos;t know the source of the basic grains of this script, however the writer-director, Raj Khosla has been able to present it in a highly impressive and entertaining manner.\n\nThe main protagonist of the story is a military officer, Lieutenant Ajay Mehra (Joy Mukherjee) who is sent on the Kashmir front in November 1947 to fight the Pakistani invaders disguised as Kabaayalis (tribals). He comes across a young bride-to-be who is fleeing for her life after the attack of the Kabaayalis at her marriage venue. While saving her life, he gets himself injured and loses his memory. The girl, Aasha (Saadhna) cares for him, taking the help of a child, Abdulla (Master Aziz ). The hero, not able to remember even his own name, leave aside the other things, soon finds himself in love with the heroine who is hesitant to respond to his advances considering that her marriage has, in the eyes of the world, taken place and socially she is a married woman (though the rites essential for a Hindu marriage through the Vedic system were not completed). She returns to her home and tells her elder uncle (she is an orphan, fostered by uncles and aunts) that neither the marital rites were fully performed, nor the groom and his greedy father are deserving people who had taken her all bridal ornaments and fled away from there, leaving her at the mercy of the invaders. Now the conscience of the uncle does not allow him to send his beloved niece with her so-called in-laws who are back to take her with them. When they try to take her away forcefully, the hero, already searching for his beloved, arrives there but the ensuing fight leads to his arrest. He escapes from the police van and moves to Bombay in search of his true identity because he had seen the label of a tailoring shop of Bombay on one of his shirts.\n\nNow starts the second half where the hero is not able to reach the desired shop because now it&apos;s been closed and replaced by a hotel but suddenly and unwillingly he gets involved in a clash with some bank robbers who are fleeing away after committing the robbery. He gets another head injury which brings back his lost memory (of his life prior to the first injury) but now another partial amnesia has taken place with him due to which he has lost memory of everything that has happened between these two injuries. The bank robbers are now relieved to find that due to this memory loss, the protagonist who now knows that he&apos;s Lieutenant Ajay Mehra of the Indian army, cannot identify them. Still, being habitual criminals, they cannot take any chances. On the other hand, the hero&apos;s cousin who was dreaming to usurp his property, considering him dead, is stunned at his return. There is a mysterious woman also who is linked to both this greedy cousin as well as the ringleader of the robbers. So there is a threat to the hero&apos;s life from more than one side. One more woman who is actually the wife of one of the robbers, also approaches the hero, claiming to be his wife. The web of conspiracy against the hero seems to be getting more and more intricate.\n\nSince his photograph alongwith the interesting tale of his memory loss and regaining the same, has been published in the national newspapers, Aasha comes to know about him and she reaches Bombay to check his welfare. But the tragedy is that he has forgotten her too due to this second amnesia. The story reaches its happy ending (the union of the lovers post the arrest of the robbers) after many thrilling moments and twists in the tale.\n\nThis movie is, in fact, a two-in-one entertainment. While the first half is dedicated to music and romance and studded with melodious and touching songs, the second half is a fast-paced thriller studded with checks and checkmates between the criminals, the hero and the Bombay police. Thus the two halves of the movie render two different types of entertainment to the audience. \n\nRaj Khosla has extracted good performances from the artists though chocolaty hero, Joy Mukherjee was not fit for anger and action (he&apos;s the best bet for romancing). Saadhna is not just gorgeous, she has acted well too. Actually a Sindhi, Saadhna completely fits the bill of a Kashmiri girl in the movie. Her trademark hairdo (the famous Saadhna-cut for ladies&apos; hair) is visible in a few sequences of the movie and a normal hairdo in the remaining part. The supporting cast and the baddies are more or less OK. \n\nO.P. Nayyar has given the music of a lifetime for this movie. While the first half contains melodies like - Mujhe Dekh Kar Aapka Muskuraana, Bahut Shukriya Badi Meherbaani, Aap Yun Hi Agar Humse Milte Rahe, Tumhen Mohabbat Hai Humse Maana, Humko Tumhaare Ishq Ne Kya Kya Bana Diya and my favourite - Phir Tere Sheher Mein Lutne Ko Chala Aaya Hoon; the second half contains some situational songs alongwith a great duet of Rafi and Asha - Aye Yaar Zulfon Waale Dildaar Zulfon Waale which is the climax of the movie. The album also contains a rare gem of Rafi - Main Pyar Ka Raahi Hoon which I did not find in the movie.\n\nNow-a-days anything is shown by the Bollywood movie makers in the name of entertainment. If somebody who is going to make a movie, really wants to know how an entertaining movie is made for the Indian audience, he should watch this movie and meet Ek Musafir (Joy Mukherjee) and Ek Hasina (Saadhna)."",""reviewRating""", , , , ,60.0

Very surprisingly they didn&apos;t work together again for the next 16 years. Pyar Zindagi hai was their collaboration after 16 years and though the film is no great shakes it is quite watchable precisely for the brilliant performance by Mohnish Bahl. Had he delievered this performance in a successful film he surely would have got a nomination for best supporting actor or best actor in a negative role. Apart from him the performances are quite ordinary especially by the leading actors. Both the actors lack spark and chemistry was missing between them which is death knell for a romantic film. Also there is a lot of stuff in the film which reminds you of Pyar Jhukta Nahin precisely the song situations, the lyrics and even certain scenes are taken from Pyar Jhukta Nahin but they are not as impactful as the former and makes the film predictable at times. Songs are hummable and good for such a low budget film. But as I said the songs and their placement are similar to Pyar Jhukta Nahin. One of the song goes like &quot;honge na juda milke&quot; which is obviously inspired by the song &quot;Chahe laakh toofan aaye....milke na honge juda&quot;. The title song will remind you of &quot;Tumse milkar na jane kyun&quot;. Rajesh Khanna is pretty ordinary and doesn&apos;t have much to do except in the climax. Overall a decent film because of Mohnish Bahl if not anything else. I personally don&apos;t like the movies of K C Bokadia except Pyar Jhukta Nahin and it is nice to see him returning to romantic genre after making dozens of violent assembly line productions."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama"",""Romance"",""Thriller""]","""2001-09-07""","{""total"":0","""2H37M""",21.0

An interesting or rather safe plot chosen by the debutant director Ritesh Menon, the film had a lot of scope of comedy (or black comedy) through its distinctive crazy characters and witty dialogues. But sadly that&apos;s not what we have as the final product here since the movie simply manages to be a light hearted family drama in totality that can only be watched in your free time at home surfing various channels and not visiting the theatres making a purposeful effort.\n\nDevoting a good 15-20 minutes in introduction as usual, it has a fairly decent first half without any full length songs as such. However post intermission nothing works really with every twist falling flat and a lot of overdoing being done by few of its key actors. For instance Shipla Shukla tries hard but isn&apos;t able to deliver a natural ease in her frank loudness and the gay marriage plot or cross dressing angle seem to be a completely misfit in an otherwise universal family format. Kushal Punjabi, Abhay Sharma, the foreign actress and others are just there to fill in the space whereas Ninad Kamat still manages to leave an impact as a suppressed husband suffering from a personality disorder.\n\nThe songs and background music try hard to win over the viewers with their timely insertions, whereas an average cinematography, sloppy editing and an all predictable screenplay (with a bizarre climax), do not let the film rise above the run-of-the-mill stuff.\n\nIn short, only one man makes his solid impression as a multi-talented person in its two hours and he is Swanand Kirkire, the lyricist-singer and actor, who once again proves that he has got a much better comic timing, screen presence and acting skill as compared to many other famous names in the industry. Swanand leads the film visibly, right from its first frame to the last and holds it together saving it from becoming a complete waste of time quite thankfully. So you can go for it (on Home video or a channel telecast of course) just for Swanand Kirkire alone and nothing else."",""reviewRating""","[""Comedy""]","""2015-01-16""","{""total"":0", ,7.0

They also provide him with supernatural weapons to help him to avenge his parents&apos; death."",""","""Released in cinemas in 1985, Shiva ka Insaaf (SkI) was touted as the first Hindi 3D movie (since the 1984 Chota Chetan - which remains for most Indians in that era the defining 3D experience - was only dubbed into Hindi from the original Malayalam). While I never actually saw it in 3D at the cinemas, I did see it on VHS in that period.\n\nSkI is a comic book type movie, with Jackie Shroff playing a masked vigilante hero called Shiva and his mild-mannered alter ego Bhola; of course in 80&apos;s Bollywood, mild-mannered translates. The obvious inspirations for Shiva are of course Batman (parents get murdered by a criminal, and hero trains for a life dedicated to crime-fighting) and Superman (mild-mannered employee at a newspaper).\n\nSkI is all about broad strokes - locations are defined as &quot;gaon&quot; (village) and &quot;shahar&quot; (city). Shiva is brought up by a Hindu-Muslim-Christian triumvirate (while he is shown to visit all the religious shrines, the Hindu component appears dominant, given the avatar he dons and the batarang style mini-tridents he hurls at his enemies). Heroine Poonam Dhillon plays an editor that goes by herself to cover stories, which usually involves sneaking into a shady location, then getting caught and having to be rescued by Shiva. The evil mastermind villain (Shakti Kapoor) runs a poorly defined crime empire, and gets his jollies setting off bombs using a TV remote.\n\nFor the action scenes, 3D means there&apos;s a good bit of pointing guns, swords and sticks towards the screen, and in the climax Shakti Kapoor and his son (Gulshan Grover) inexplicably start firing flaming arrows at the hero. There is some hilarious use of toy cars, dolls/puppets and very obvious miniatures. Apart from one decent romance number, RD Burman&apos;s score is wholly forgettable. But for nostalgics of 80&apos;s action masala SkI is not a bad way of spending 2 hours."",""reviewRating""", , , ,"""2H5M""",37.0

Shashi Kapoor is a misfit both as a lover and a police inspector. And Poonam Dhillon- why is she even in the film. Her role makes no sense, has no importance in the film and has barely any screen space in the film (and dies quite unnecessarily in the end as she does in many of her other films). Suresh Oberoi in his brief role is good. The film is good in the first half due to the story focusing on Rati Agnihotri, as soon as the film gets into the action mode it derails from its path. The second half is comparatively weaker than the first half which dilutes the overall impact. Also the editing is very haphazard at many places and transitions are not smooth.

Fate eventually sets their paths for a head on collision."",""","""Shortly the day of Ganesh Visarjan is arriving which day the devotees immerse the idols of Lord Ganesha, the god of wisdom &apos;n&apos; removal of hurdles in any work, which had been installed on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi (the fourth day of the bright fortnight of the Bhaadrapad month as per the Indian calendar) are immersed in water. Lord Ganesha has been one of the most popular gods of the Hindu community and he is the first one to be invited on any auspicious occasion may it be the marriage ceremony or the house-warming ceremony. I am also a devotee of Him and have fasting on every Wednesday since long. I very fondly listen to the devotional songs related to Him. The song which I like most among them is - Deva O Deva, Ganpati Deva, Tumse Badhkar Kaun, Aur Tumhaare Bhakt Janon Mein Humse Badhkar Kaun (O Lord Ganpati, who is better than you and who is better than us among your devotees ?). This song is from the movie Hum Se Badhkar Kaun (1981) which I am reviewing today.\n\nHumse Badhkar Kaun (who is better than us) is based on the old and hackneyed &apos;Lost &amp; Found&apos; formula of the Indian movies. Normally, two brothers (or sisters or one brother and one sister) are shown as being separated in their childhood who reunite when grown-up. There are certain movies in which three brothers are shown as being separated as such viz. Yaadon Ki Baaraat (1973), Amar Akbar Anthony (1977), Aahuti (1978) etc. Humse Badhkar Kaun is unique in this regard that it shows four brothers getting separated in their childhood, they grow up in different environments and avail different personalities and enter different professions. This regular potboiler is an entertaining movie.\n\nThese four brothers are Chandan, Bablu, Raaju and Pappu whose father is killed by the villain of the story - Laalchand (Ranjeet) and the children get separated from their mother Raadha (Purnima) as well as one another. They grow up under different environments and quite naturally become different kinds of adults. The eldest one, i.e., Chandan grows up as Bholaraam (Amjad Khan) and becomes a milkman. The second one, i.e., Bablu becomes an honest and dutiful cop - Vijay (Vijayendra Ghaatage), the third one, i.e., Raaju becomes a burglar - Johnny (Danny Dengjongpa) and the youngest one, i.e., Pappu becomes a robber-under-a-mask - Tony (Mithun Chakraborty). Well, for these foursome, four love-interests are also required. Hence we have the heroines in the form of Kammo (Padmini Kapila), Rekha (Kaajal Kiran), Jeena (Neeta Mehta) and Teena (Ranjeeta). These brothers cross path with one another as well as the baddie according to the screenplay written for them.\n\nThe fact that forms the basis of different activities on the part of the various characters of this story and also lays down the foundation of the action-packed climax is a treasure whose the deceased father of the boys was a custodian of and he had given one key of the lock of that treasure to each one of his sons (total four keys were there). The keys are not identical. They are different and the treasure can be unlocked by applying all the keys only one after the other. Quite naturally, the villain is after the treasure. Finally, the brothers including the law-breaking ones, the law-abiding one and the law-enforcing one, join hands to seek their revenge from the villain, ensure that the treasure goes into the correct hands, reunite with each other as well as their lost mother and (but natural) get their sweethearts to end this movie.\n\nDirector Deepak Baahri has directed the movie in the style of the regular Bollywood potboilers and there is nothing extra-ordinary about it. All the same, the movie is entertaining and can be given a watch for that reason. The beginning, the take off, the development and the climax of the narrative; all are routine and well-identified for those who have seen a lot of such masaala movies during the sixties, the seventies and the eighties. Despite this, the movie proves engrossing once the spectator is in and starts enjoying the movie without taxing his mind. Considering the fact that it contains four heroes and four heroines, there is an ample quota of romance. The romantic track of Bholaaraam, the milkman and Kammo (Padmini Kapila), his English teacher is the most amusing and entertaining one.\n\nTechnically the movie is in line with several such run-of-the-mill movies made during that period. Nothing great but nothing poor also.\n\nRaamlaxman could not prepare memorable music with the lyrics of Ravindra Rawal. Except Deva O Deva Ganpati Deva, the songs are average fare.\n\nThe heroines meet the objective of being eye-candy for the audience because there is nothing much for them in this male-oriented script based on the theme of crime and revenge. This movie belongs to the heroes and all of them have done their respective jobs very well. I especially mention Amjad Khan who has infused life into the role of a milkman. While watching this movie, it&apos;s pretty difficult to think that this actor only immortalized Gabbar Singh of Sholay on the screen. Ranjeet as the villain and the other supporting cast members are routine.\n\nWhile shouting Ganpati Baappa Moriya, I recommend Humse Badhkar Kaun as a nice timepass to the entertainment-seekers."",""reviewRating""","[""Adventure"",""Drama""]","""1981-07-03""","""parents""", ,41.0

Making a review is not an easy task, but I will try doing it, for those who enjoy watching old Hindi movies, and of course for those who are fans of Dharmendra and Hema Malini.\n\nThe movie, show us, how a person can transform from an honest one into a great mobster who is not listening his conscience any more.\n\nSunny (Dharmendra) is very much in love with Mona (Hema Malini). One day, Sunny saves a man&apos;s life, without knowing that this person is the chief of a maritime company ( company that in fact makes illicit deeds). He does not accept the offer of working with him, nor his money, saying he is honest and he can never make an illegal thing.\n\nOn the other hand, Mona&apos;s father is indebted with another thief (the one who wanted to kill the chief of the maritime company). Mona is forced to marry this guy, if she want&apos;s that her father&apos;s life continue in no danger. \n\nAnd here, interferes the old choice between listening your conscience or listening to your heart. Once again the heart wins. Sunny agrees eventually to work for the mobster, and like that he is able to pay the credit of Mona&apos;s father. He eventually marries Mona, and becomes himself the brain of all the illegal operation of the company. Mona in fact has now idea that her husband, Sunny, from a good and honest fellow has transformed in a wholesale liar. \n\nOne day, after seeing the doctor and finding that they will be parents, Sunny and Mona, have an accident. Mona, who is full of faith, manages to make Sunny understand that he has to give up his life of illicit deeds in order to keep his wife. In this accident he meets Ram (Jeetendra).\n\nDecided to give up his life as a smuggler, Sunny undertakes a last operation, before giving up with all. \n\nAnd of course he is almost caught. He manages to escape, but after giving up his disguise, he is sen, by no other then Ram (Jeetendra).\n\nEventually Sunny is arrested, together with Mona in whose umbrella are found some missing diamonds. For saving Mona from going to jail, Sunny explains to Ram in which circumstances he became a smuggler and swear that he will give up that life and that the diamond&apos;s business was the last one in which he would have been participating.\n\nRam, does not believe him, and decides to declare against him at the trial. And from this decision things degenerate, in a continuing pursuit of Sunny getting rid of Ram.\n\nI am letting you discover the final. For those who know and love the pair Dharmendra Hema Malini, it will be a delight to see their love story put on screen (because on the time when the movie was made they were already married). Their interpretation is great, like the one of Jeetendra and Reka of course.\n\nMy note is 8/10. I did not quite enjoy the final though it&apos;s a good one.""},""aggregateRating""","[""Action""]","""1987-08-14""","{""total"":0","""2H40M""",35.0

I latched on to this as I was researching on India made war movies of all times as I am fond of watching good war movies. However I am not at all repulsive to old Romantic movies rather some of my all time favourites are from Romantic Genre only. So after I read the synopsis which tells that this movie blends a love story amid Indo-Pak war of 1971 made me more curious to watch it thinking that it might turn out to be another near perfect movie for me. I got more interested after I watched the video of the movie&apos;s song &apos;Dekho Veer Jawaano ko&apos; which suprebly displayed the army vehicles and the armed personnel with their guns marching and boarding their vehicles to go to the war front it was an inspiring scene with an inspiring song in the background.\n\nBut seriously this movie wasn&apos;t even close to what I expected, this two hour plus drama misreably fails to tell love story and neither it dedicates quality time to the combat or war scenes. The cinematography turns out to be average even if you take into consideration the time period when it was made. Both leading charaters of the movie are army officers and seriously I did not find any near resemblance with real Armed forces high ranking officers it simply points that moviemakers didn&apos;t work properly on the details. It never means that Sanjiv Kumar, Ashok Kumar or Rekhaji&apos;s acting wasn&apos;t good rather they were the saving grace but I will discredit the director for not using such high skilled actors to portray the characters properly. Rakesh Roshan wasn&apos;t good as he has given us much better performances than this as an actor.\n\nIn the end movie comes across as a disjointed mishmash of a love story and war, it did not do justice to it&apos;s love story and if by mistake any war movie buff happens to watch thinking of this as war movie then he will regret his decision, such mistake can happen because this movie find it&apos;s name in the list of &apos;war movies&apos; made by India. I strongly have my objection on that recommendation, it&apos;s title is so misleading.\n\nI have given two stars only for the legendary actors and some good songs."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama"",""History"",""Romance""]","""1975-05-14""","""soldier,patriotism,courage,handicapped,army officer""","""2H19M""",47.0

When he comes upon one of his subjects, Niloufer (Meena Kumari), he stakes his claim on her and wants her to be his wife, despite of his ..."",""","""Pran is no more. The cruel and deadly villain of Bollywood movies who was so much hated by the audience that for a very long period, the Indian parents were not ready to christen their newly born sons as Pran. Despite being a versatile actor, Pran Sikand was typecast in villainous roles for around two decades. While paying my tribute to the legendary on-screen villain who was a great human-being in his personal life, I am presenting the review of a black and white period movie in which Pran has played the title role and interestingly the title of the movie is after the villain and not the hero. This unique B&amp;W classic is Halaaku (1956).\n\nHalaaku was the grandson of the ruthless and fearsome Mongol invader Changez Khan. He occupied vast areas of Iraq, China, Russia, Afghanistan etc with his valour. However this movie deals with his occupying and ruling of Iran. This movie is a brilliant mix of romance, action and sentiments with Pran being all pervasive in the pivotal role of Halaaku.\n\nThe love story of Parvez (Ajit) and Neelofer (Meena Kumari) is at the centre of the movie. The main twist comes in the story when the then ruler of Iran, Halaaku (Pran) happens to see Neelofer and stakes his claim on her. Living in a patriarchal social milieu, the women did not have any say in such vital matters of their own lives those days and the clear rule was &apos;beauty belongs to the mighty&apos;. In such a situation, quite naturally, the onus of saving Neelofer from Halaaku and also saving her love to meet a tragic death falls on her beau Parvez.The movie very impressively narrates how Parvez is able to demonstrate his valour to Halaaku and wins a bet compelling Halaaku to fulfill a promise made by him to Parvez. But the thing that wins Halaaku&apos;s heart is not Parvez&apos;s valour but his patriotism and putting his nation above his love and his sweetheart. Won over by the patriotism of Parvez, cruel and insensitive Halaaku is able to explore his soul and then he takes an unexpected decision. The villain comes out of the gaberdine of villain in the end and demonstrates his big heart and sensitivity towards others&apos; feelings.\n\nI had watched Halaaku on Doordarshan some three decades back and was taken aback by the stunning performance of Pran in the title role. Though the hero of the movie is Ajit, it&apos;s Pran who won all the accolades of the audience and the critics alike through his mesmerizing performance. He is the villain of the story, mind it. Ajit and Meena Kumari have also done well as the romantic lead pair. Minoo Mumtaaz playing the Christian wife of Halaaku (who is strongly against his marrying another woman, i.e., Neelofer) is also admirable.The complete supporting cast including the great dancer Helen has also performed satisfactorily.\n\nIt&apos;s difficult for me to say as to how much the story of the movie stands true to the history. However as the Salim-Anarkali love story is immortal despite not being corroborated by the history, the same can be asserted for this movie also. The script is very well written and the director (D.D. Kashyap) has ably directed it. There is no boredom in the movie and the narrative keeps the audience hooked throughout.\n\nAll the technical aspects of the movie including its length are well in order and there cannot be two opinions that Halaaku is a very well made movie. The time of the thirteenth century A.D. has been created quite admirably on the screen.\n\nShankar-Jaikishan have composed highly admirable music for the movie with the help of the beautiful and touching lyrics of Shailendra. Almost all the songs are quite good to listen. Two songs of the album are immortal - 1. Aaja Ke Intezaar Mein Jaane Ko Hai Bahaar Bhi which is an unforgettable sentimental duet of Lata and Rafi, 2. Dil Ka Na Karna Aitbaar Koi which is a memorable sad song of Lata.\n\nWith my salute to the one and only Pran Saheb, I recommend this classic movie from the black and white era to not only the admirers of Pran, Meena Kumari and Ajit but also to all those movie buffs who take interest in watching such gems from the treasure of Hindi cinema."",""reviewRating""", , , ,"""2H2M""",66.0

Things got more worse when she is possessed by a soul and started to commit real murders."",""","""Kafan was released in 1990 when lots of cut price Halloween masks were widely used. Veteran &apos;Vampire Killer&apos; Javed Khan has done justice to his role and Jamuna plays the regular scream queen. The story is about 4 men and a black magician seeking immortality and other supernatural powers. The movie is incredibly long and one wishes it to end up soon, but that&apos;s not the case, one is also excited to see so many evil gizmos till the final scores are settled by Lord Almighty thyself. A twisted tale of vengeance, where a victim of rape becomes a witch and possesses Jamuna.\n\nThe film begins with two Tantriks, one of which is sane and Mr. Goodie-to-shoes, while the other is a devil worshipper. Raza Murad and his 3 other friends want to be immortal and for this they are taking help of the evil black magician. The black magician asks them to bring a virgin girl for sacrifice. Two of the partners happen to find one girl Poonam, but paralyzed by lust, rape her till she faints. The rapists don&apos;t disclose anything to their friends. The ritual starts, and Poonam soon transforms to an evil hag, kills the black magician and is now after her tormentors.\n\nJaved Khan is a police inspector and is in love with Jamuna. Their relationship is going on fairly well when things get disrupted and Jamuna begins to see things that happen far away. Yes, she receives telepathic signals when something unpleasant happens somewhere. At first Javed disbelieves her but when all the accidents are proved, he understands that something is fishy. Meanwhile Jamuna is haunted by the evil forces and her body soon becomes the home of Poonam&apos;s vindictive spirit. Under the effect of evil spirit she goes deranged and becomes the sole representative of the trauma-stricken Poonam. Soon after the city is under threat of a horrific witch, who would destroy anything on her way. With much difficulty Javed Khan is able to finish the series of havoc once and for all.\n\nThere are several scenes of mayhem which make the movie exceptionally better than most of the other contemporary Bollywood movies of horror genre. The haunted building shown in the film is fairly eerie and reminds me of Lucio Fulci&apos;s hotel cum portal to hell in &apos;The Beyond&apos;. The movie is long but beautifully manages to create anticipated space for horror. Some scenes are filmed so nicely that one can surely feel the sense of isolation even when surrounded by his whole family. The good thing about Kafan is that it highlights only those cheesy, tension-clad, sleazy moments, that viewers expect from a good horror film. The dance numbers by Jamuna and Javed Khan and comedy sequences by Johnny Lever, Huma Khan and Tina Ghai are infantile and also the loop holes in the plot. Shortening the movie by an hour or so (removing the comedy sequences and useless dance numbers) could have qualified it as a pure saga of horror.\n\nWhat I like about Kafan is that it teems with those aspects of Bollywood horror that most of the other Bollywood horror films miss. To be honest it doesn&apos;t feature stolen elements, retrograded scenes, insufferable comedy and has very few dance numbers. It&apos;s a demonic, chilling, undoubtedly cheap, Desi chute-the-chute ride of horror."",""reviewRating""","[""Horror""]","""1990-08-01""","""murder""","""2H27M""",32.0

The plot is hardly convincing and the proceedings rarely ring true. This is a stale tale of a mother&apos;s &apos;sacrifice&apos;. Nutan plays Asha Chopra, a middle-aged mother of three. Three daughters they are, the eldest is a typical action star, the second is a good girl, and the third is a cute kid who has some sort of heart disease. Asha&apos;s husband is not in town, and when he unexpectedly dies, she keeps it in secret as such sudden news may kill her youngest daughter, who loves her dad the most. Then we also get the usual drunkard who blackmails Asha and threatens to reveal her secret. Yeh, this movie is a fairytale of sorts, which has little to do with reality, and has little to offer to its audience. Some of its sequences are hilarious, unintentionally of course, as we see the elder daughter fighting with guys in true Hindi film style. Nutan is an accomplished actor and rarely did she do wrong with her acting, but how much can even a great thespian like her ultimately do with such a silly character? She is good within the context of the film, but is overall let down by the script, which never allows her to utilise her true talent, and sadly so. The movie belongs to her though, and the supporting actors, too, struggle with thin characters which do not compliment them in any way. Some of the songs are nice but nothing great. Saajan Bina Suhagan is a most ordinary and boring melodrama which has few, if any, redeeming qualities, though lovers of typical Hindi weepies may enjoy it."",""reviewRating""","[""Crime"",""Drama"",""Family""]","""1981-01-01""","{""total"":0","""2H1M""",44.0

However, this is the tale of two lookalikes and not twins. \n\nA college student Vijay (Jeetendra) is under severe financial duress and wants to get Rs 3,000 for his mother&apos;s cancer treatment. All options fail and he tries to steal the money from a home unsuccessfully. But the owner is Vinod (Jeetendra), his lookalike, and the simpleton helps him out with the money. One day, Vinod lands up at his doorstep, terrified by the acts of his maternal brother and maternal uncle - who treat him worse than a dog and want to usurp his wealth. Vijay decides to help out Vinod, and set everything right in his life, in an attempt to pay back his favor. What happens next is total hilarity and one wonderful sequence after another. \n\nThis is the type of movie where you let your hair down and do not care much about the realism. A total fun film, with Jeetendra delivering from the front in both roles and aided by Reena Roy, Anwar Hussain, Ramesh Deo and Srividya, this is the sort of movie families liked to go to in the past with kids in tow.\n\nDirection by Murugan Kumaran is tight, and he does not let the film wander unnecessarily with boring comic tracks. A special mention about the music - the title track is a ear worm and can be played on loop. When viewed with the picturization of Jeetendra whipping the evil Prakash Chand (Ramesh Deo), you are likely to go berserk. Ab Ke Saawan is a legendary track, and has been remixed many times but comes without any vulgarity. Kaun Si Woh Cheez dedicated to mothers is a sweet and emotional track that will make you love your mom even more. Bhaiya Re is a fantastic dance track with Jeetu and Reena. Chalte Chalte is a good romantic number while the haunting Sajan Kaha Jaungi Main Vapas (which is the &apos;Fire Esho Anuradha&apos; track in Bengali) by Lata is excellent. R.D was a genius. \n\nThe film was a super-hit and deserved to be so. A remake of Telugu Movie Bullema Bullodu (1972), this one deserves to be watched many times as it comes with great repeat value. You can watch it with friends, all alone and even with kids. I am taking out 1 star for a comical cleavage shot and slight double entendre.

The highlight of the movie is the clarinet played in this movie by the legendary clarinet-player, Ustad Bismillah Khan Saheb. Though bollywood is a never-exhausting treasure of love stories, very few love stories have portrayed the depth of this sublime emotion in such a realistically penetrating way. This outstanding movie pronounces loud and clear that the true love is for the soul and not for the body.\n\nThis is the story of the immortal love of Gopi (Ameeta) and Kishan (Rajender Kumar). Kishan is a clarinet player and learns the same from his Guru, Raghunath Maharaj(Ulhas) whose daughter Ramkali (Anita Guha) has a strange love for him. She knows that Kishan loves Gopi and has complete sympathy for them. Kishan&apos;s poverty does not allow him to marry Gopi whose matrimonial alliance is fixed with Shekhar (Pratap Kumar) who does a decent job in the radio station of Lucknow. The exposure of the love of Kishan and Gopi in the village compels Kishan to leave the village but Ramkali being concerned for his well-being, goes alongwith him. Kishan meets Shekhar in Lucknow and starts playing the clarinet on radio. Now he gets name and fame (and money too) but when he returns to get his lost love back, he is shocked to see that Gopi&apos;s wedding is taking place with Shekhar (despite herself being in a partially fainted state). Broken-heart Kishan is back now, only to find solace from Ramkali. On the other hand, Gopi has got insentient after separation from Kishan and in such a condition, her maternal uncle(Manmohan Krishna) who has always been sympathetic to her, does not allow her to be sent to her Sasural (in-laws&apos; home). Ultimately she comes to senses by listening to Kishan&apos;s clarinet only. But knowing that she is a wedded woman now, she, as per the Indian Samsakaras and traditional norms embedded in her, starts her journey to reach her husband, leaving Kishan behind. However this separation is not acceptable to the souls of these lovers and that forms the climax.\n\nThe movie contains several melodious songs but they are aptly placed and does not block the flow of the story.\n\nI highlight certain significant plus points of the movie separately ", , , ,"""2H54M""",63.0

I have all the respect for Gulzar for his movies like Mausam, Mere Apne etc, movies that deal with challenging social subjects, but when it comes to historical narratives like Maachis and Jallianwala Bagh, his narratives display a woeful lack of research.  The plot of Jallianwala Bagh is a confused one. Gulzar seems unsure if he wants to tell the story of the massacre or the story of revenge carried out by Shaheed Udham Singh. As a result, he is unable to do justice to either. Jallianwala Bagh is the story of thousands of people of this city and nearby villages who paid the ultimate price for challenging the might of the British Empire. This film does not have a consistent narrative, the characters are two-dimensional and Gulzar has completely ignored the role of local leadership.  The production value of this film is extremely low. Seems as if some government grant was received and patchy film was created. It had great actors like Vinod Khanna, Parikshit Sahni, and Deepti Naval (who grew up in Amritsar!) What stupendous waste of talent! No wonder the film did not get many takers!  I am trying to find a producer for a film on this subject but what chance do I have when Gulzar&apos;s name has been associated with this failed project.

As a wealthy, handsome and well spoken man many women have designs on him, none more so than Rita and her mother.\n\nThe film begins with Akash and his sidekick Madan Lal driving in a targa (open top) Standard Herald and a ball lands in the car. Akash and Neela have a rhetorical conversation,laced with irony about return of the ball. Little do they know then that their lives will intertwine, and they will sing together to the tunes of Scottish bagpipes.\n\nMadan Lal (Mehmood) provides some comic relief through his amorous interludes. His oft repeated dialogue &quot;one button-hole, one button. One heart, one woman&quot; is put to the test when three women buttonhole him as he emerges from a shower.\n\nShot mostly in Delhi, the picturesque Lodhi Gardens forms a scenic backdrop for romantic interludes, while the specter of Chinese aggression looms in the background.When Akash receives his call-up, he is ready, and ready to give up his life to fulfil his mission of delivering documents. In a fit of pique, he throws away the safety talisman given him by Neela, but lives to see the value of love.\n\nFrom a social perspective, the values that Akash and his mother espouse, such as &quot;sins of the father shall not be held against the daughter&quot; are pioneering for the time. Very few families allowed their daughters to work in those days. Neela went to work because of the failure of her father; but her road was not easy.\n\nThe acting is superb, the plot is rather intense, songs are forgettable, though the lyrics are appropriate to the sequence context.\n\nA great movie to watch to see Connaught Place as it was in the sixties, Race Course, Lodhi Gardens etc.,"",""reviewRating""", , , , ,57.0

It is a must watch for Rajesh Khanna and Shatrughan Sinha fans, they will enjoy the dramatic scenes between the silent romantic Super Star and the loud, boisterous Shot Gun Sinha."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama"",""Romance""]","""1982-06-04""","{""total"":0", ,40.0

It&apos;s a coloured movie which was released in the transition period of Bollywood from the black &amp; white era to the era of colours. This movie is mainly remembered for a classic song sung by both Mohammad Rafi and Lata Mangeshkar - Dil Jo Na Keh Saka, Wohi Raaz-e-Dil Kehne Ki Raat Aaee. Otherwise also, it&apos;s an entertaining movie whose story has been set in the beautiful locales of Nainitaal, the Queen of the Hills.\n\nBheegi Raat (drenched night or rainy night) starts with a fateful night in which an orphan girl - Neelima (Meena Kumari) escapes from the claws of a rapist to whom her guardian had sold her. She finds shelter in the house of a kind and benevolent lady - Pushpa (Kaamini Kaushal) who is in need of a reliable governess for her small niece - Munni (Baby Irani), the daughter of her widower brother - Anand (Ashok Kumar) who is a businessman and has been spending a lot of time in London since his wife&apos;s death. During the performance of her duty as the governess, she happens to come across Ajay (Pradeep Kumar) who is actually the son of a businessman based in Mumbai (then Bombay) but has left his home due to his father&apos;s pressurizing him to marry a rich brat - Vineeta (Shashikala) and arrived there to develop his art of painting in the peaceful and beautiful hill-station, i.e., Nainitaal. Ajay rents a house in the neighbourhood of Neelima and they come close pretty soon, falling in love with each other.\n\nPushpa, on the other hand, perceives Neelima as her prospective sister-in-law (BHAABHI) because coincidentally, Neelima has a resemblance with Anand&apos;s wife and Munni&apos;s mother who is no more. When Anand returns from London, he is also startled to find this resemblance of Neelima with his deceased wife. Seeing Neelima&apos;s affection for his little daughter, he also starts looking at her the same way as his sister is. And now the love-triangle is complete with two males - Anand and Ajay being desirous of marrying Neelima. Now our heroine is in a fix. She loves Ajay but feels the burden of Pushpa&apos;s obligation too on her mind. The story moves further with twists coming in the tale at intervals. Pushpa passes away and after a lot of drama, Anand removes himself from the middle of Ajay and Neelima, paving the way for their union.\n\nThe negative aspect of this formula-based movie is its lacklustre script with many over the top things and certain over the top characters. The script writers and the director (Kaalidaas) remained satisfied with some well-executed sequences, good acting, good location and good music and did not pay attention to preparing a logical, coherent and convincing screenplay. However, from the viewpoint of watching an entertaining movie, the audience can very well ignore the weakness of the script and enjoy the pluses of the movie. The pluses are, of course, many.\n\nThe biggest plus point, in my opinion, is the beautiful setting of Nainitaal. I have never found this hilly town coming on the screen so beautifully in any other movie. Still the colours of the movie are quite bright and different scenes filmed in the beautiful locations of Nainitaal are perfect eye-candy for the movie-buffs. The cinematographer has done a marvellous job in capturing the beauty scattered in Nainitaal in that period (of almost half a century ago).\n\nAnother plus point is performances. All the three protagonists - Ashok Kumar, Meena Kumari and Pradeep Kumar have done very well. While watching the movies of the sixties, I am always amazed to see how brilliantly Ashok Kumar played the roles of romantic lead while in the fifties of his life. He appears quite fit and smart despite his advanced years. Kaamini Kaushal who herself was a romantic heroine just a few years prior to this movie, has played the role of the affectionate sister and aunt as well as a benevolent lady effectively. The other members of the supporting cast have also done justice to the assigned roles. Hari Shivdaasani as Colonel Bhim Singh who is the landlord of Ajay and a close friend of Anand, is memorable. Shashikala was the most successful vamp in the Bollywood movies of that period and in this movie also, she has played the vamp with perfection.\n\nTwo scenes of this movie stand out in terms of execution and performances. One is Anand&apos;s seeing Neelima and Ajay in romantic position in the new year eve party when he had decided to quit drinking (upon Neelima&apos;s insistence) and brought coffee for himself and Neelima. His romantic dreams involving Neelima get shattered upon seeing that and then he breaks the coffee mugs and decides to celebrate the arrival of the new year with liquor only. The second scene is the hunting scene (involving several wild animals) when out of manly jealousy, Anand first plans to arrange Ajay&apos;s death by the wild elephants but seeing Neelima&apos;s condition (she accompanies both these males on their hunting adventure), changes his mind and saves Ajay&apos;s life. It&apos;s a sensational scene.\n\nRoshan&apos;s music with Majrooh&apos;s lyrics is another highlight of Bheegi Raat. In addition to the unforgettable - Dil Jo Na Keh Saka, the other songs of the movie are also quite good viz. Mohabbat Se Dekha Khafa Ho Gaye Hain, Jaane Woh Kaun Hai, Aise To Na Dekho Ki Bahak Jaayen Kahin Hum etc.\n\nI recommend Bheegi Raat as a decent timepass movie to the regular movie buffs."",""reviewRating""", , , ,"""2H37M""",57.0

The film gets straight to the point right after the principle characters are introduced. Chatterjee tells an engaging story that keeps the viewer. It&apos;s also interesting to see how he cast the same actors in different roles of the present setting and the past life. However, the writing is faulty at places and the end looks very rushed. Ashok Kumar&apos;s doctor character suffers from poor writing. The role lacks dimension and it only confuses the viewer on how he knows so much about Gauri and Gangadhar. It&apos;s quite a pity because this character presents the turning point of &apos;Tumhare Liye&apos;. Chatterjee cleverly balances the contrast between the modern day and the early 1900s very well. Not only does one see a difference in clothing and setting but even the actors have displayed different gestures and attitude that separate the time. Sanjeev Kumar is excellent as the modern husband who is sexually frustrated and confused so much that he almost rapes his wife. He is equally convincing as the calm and peaceful monk Gangadhar. Vidya Sinha too is incredible as the possessed wife and the vivacious village belle. An average actress could have easily messed up the role of the confused, terrified and depressed wife but this actress knows her craft well enough to pull it off. Ashok Kumar is adequate as Gauri&apos;s village uncle but as the doctor he is letdown by lack of character dimension. Neelam Mehra holds her own. Jaidev&apos;s music is great. Om Shivpuri is hilarious as the stoned monk. It&apos;s not an out and out comic role but the comedy of it is more subtle. The songs are hummable and suit the situation. Cinematography is brilliant as the camera is used very effectively. To conclude, &apos;Tumhare Liye&apos; tells an interesting story but the film itself could have been a tad better if the writing was a little more solid. Nonetheless it&apos;s worth a watch because of everything I mentioned above. However, it might not appeal to everyone, particularly those who do not enjoy movies with the reincarnation theme.""},""aggregateRating""", , , , ,44.0

This is the basic plot and from the story you realise that its nothing but a typical 70s film. However, a film like this is okay for a 1980s release as it might still work. 1990s and later would be the worst time period as by now these kind of movies don&apos;t fit as the typical entertainer.\n\nOn the Whole, the film is a pile of garbage but it works mainly as Sanjay Dutt film. When he was young he was more energetic and most of his films from the 80s saw a young and enthusastic Dutt perform on the bigscreen. This was a delight to see and Anita Raaj is good as the heroine. Their chemistry is decent but the pairing of Annuradha Patel and the other Dutt(father) is bad as the chemistry is missing."",""reviewRating""","[""Action""]","""1985-10-25""","""girl,drunk girl""","""2H19M""",37.0

It deals with a whole lot of fun, romance and suspense. It is story of an innocent boy Vicky. The plot involves an innocent poor boy, who is a happy go lucky, always trying to live ..."",""","""Abbaas-Mustaan are considered as the Alfred Hitchcock of Indian cinema. Their disciple Dinkar Kapur decided to direct a movie independently and he made the script from the leftovers of the movies of his gurus for that purpose. The suspense-thriller thus coming into existence is Yeh Kaisi Mohabbat (2002) which stars Govinda&apos;s nephew (sister&apos;s son) - Krishna (now he is known as Krishna Abhishek) in lead role.\n\nYeh Kaisi Mohabbat (what kind of a love is it ?) is the story of Vicky who wants to lead an affluent life by trapping some rich girl in his love and thereby marrying her. Soon he is able to do so with Tina (Deeksha). However when he comes into contact with a wealthy person Rahul Thakraal (Sharad Kapoor) and gets the assignment of spying his wife, he&apos;s shocked to find that Rahul&apos;s wife is Tina only. But the truth is something else. Rahul&apos;s wife is actually Priya (Viveka Babaji) who gets murdered and the police goes after Vicky considering him only the murderer. The real murderer is unmasked in the end.\n\nDinkar Kapur and the screenplay writer Y.N. Kapoor succeeded in preparing the script of this murder mystery by assembling various scenes like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle and generously used the finances of the producer Ashok Kotwaani by shooting on foreign locations. However this and exposing the physic of the heroine is not sufficient to make a quality suspense-thriller. Dinkar Kapur has made an expensive movie which, due to his poor sense of filmmaking, could not rise above a B grade masaala flick.\n\nThe suspense is intriguing no doubt which keeps the viewer guessing about the real murderer till the climax and that&apos;s the first and the foremost ingredient of a good mystery. However the casting and the treatment of the plot is certainly B grade and does not render an air of an excellent suspense-thriller. Frankly, I don&apos;t think that there should be any gradation of movies because a movie is either good or bad but the public responds to the movies by perceiving them as such only. And that&apos;s the tragedy of this movie.\n\nThe movie is an entertaining mystery nonetheless which contains a good dose of romance also. Good performance by Krishna in the lead role has helped the script and the direction. Among the other cast members - Mukesh Rishi has done admiringly as the investigating police officer whereas Sharad Kapoor, Deepak Tijori etc. are also well in place. Johny Lever has left no stone unturned in boring the audience by his stale comedy. Heroine Deeksha has exposed more, acted less (perhaps that&apos;s what the director wanted her to do). Late Viveka Babaji who was a well known model, could not do much in this the only acting job done in her life.\n\nTechnically and production value wise, the movie is up to the mark. Sandeep Chowta has composed music quite reasonably in at least two songs - Akeli Hai Raat and Lafda Hai.\n\nAll in all, I can say that Dinkar Kapur has been only partially successful in imitating his gurus, i.e., Abaas-Mustaan. However this so-called B grade movie is an interesting murder mystery which can be recommended as a one time watch to at least those who are fond of the movies of this genre."",""reviewRating""","[""Musical"",""Drama"",""Romance""]","""2002-05-31""","{""total"":0","""2H40M""",20.0

That brilliant movie boasts of very good script (Naasir Hussain), direction (Vijay Anand), music (R.D. Burman) and above all, Shammi Kapoor, the legendary hero who changed the rules made for a Bollywood movie hero during the sixties and accordingly the perception of the audience in this regard. Sixties was undoubtedly the decade of Late Shammi Kapoor who is still loved and missed by the Hindi movie audience and Teesri Manzil is a milestone movie of his career.\n\nWhen Late Gulshan Kumar, the so-called audio cassette king had earned a lot of money through his business of music which mainly contained the cover versions of the golden oldies from Hindi movies (prepared in the voices of newcomer singers), he decided to launch his younger brother Krishan Kumar as a hero in Hindi cinema. He did so perhaps out of the affection of an elder brother because Krishan Kumar did not possess the personality of a typical Bollywood hero. Anyway, when the hero has been selected, naturally, a story is also required to make a feature film. So Gulshan Kumar arranged a video cassette of Teesri Manzil and gave it to writer Pawan Sethi to prepare a script on the lines of that classic musical suspense thriller. The result of that exercise came out in the form of the script of Aaja Meri Jaan (1993).\n\nThus Aaja Meri Jaan (come, my sweetheart) is a suspense movie which is nothing but a remake of Teesri Manzil. It&apos;s been directed by Ketan Anand, the son of the legendary director Chetan Anand and it features Shammi Kapoor also in a supporting role. A newcomer girl Taanya Singh was given a break as the heroine of this movie. Several songs got prepared by Gulshan Kumar for the music album, hiring the services of many music directors including the legendary Pancham Da (R.D. Burman) himself who had prepared the unforgettable gems for Teesri Manzil decades back. And finally the movie was released for the Indian audience with a lot of hype and publicity. However the wise Indian audience immediately caught that this movie was nothing but the old wine known as Teesri Manzil in a new bottle and this launch-pad of Krishan Kumar got only a lukewarm response from the public.\n\nThe movie opens with the scene of a murder only. The victim is the priest of a temple who is stabbed to death by someone. Cut to the scene of the local police station where another gentleman clad in a priest-like clothes only visits the concerned officer to inquire about the progress of the police in the quest of the murderer and he gets the standard reply of Indian police that they are on the job. Now our smart young hero Chaand Kapoor (Krishan Kumar) who appears to have the aptitude of a skirt-chaser, comes into picture. His father (Shammi Kapoor) is already facing financial problems and his extravagant nature only aggravates them. Chaand comes into contact with the heroine (Taanya Singh) and falls for her charms. However she is aggrieved by her elder sister&apos;s death and is more interested in finding out her murderer than getting into any love affair. The twist in this confused love story comes when the heroine comes to know that it&apos;s the hero only claiming to be her lover, who might be having a hand in her sister&apos;s death. Things are further complicated by the activities of a smuggling gang. Finally our hero is able to lift curtain from every mystery of this story and unmask the culprits behind the smuggling exercise as well as the murders that have taken place. Quite expectedly, now the heroine falls into his arms for good.\n\nThe script has been written by picking the basic grains and the story framework from Teesri Manzil by making some peripheral changes in that here and there. However the writer as well as the director of this movie could not use the brilliant story idea properly to make a good suspense-thriller. The story starts with a murder but soon the focus shifts on the philandering and carefree activities of the hero who appears a loafer from his face. To confuse the audience regarding the identity of the culprit, too many angles and tracks have been forced into the narrative which exhaust more and entertain less. The revelation of the identity of the principal criminal (the boss of the smugglers&apos; gang) does not create any sensation for the audience. Still courtesy the quality of the original story idea, the movie has not been reduced to something like crap. Overall, it&apos;s endurable for any regular movie buff (provided he has not seen Teesri Manzil already).\n\nPerformances wise talking, the supporting cast including the baddies, has done well. Taanya Singh could not be Aasha Paarekh (the heroine of Teesri Manzil) and thankfully, she did not do any other movie in her career. For Krishan Kumar, let me say that Gulshan Kumar forgot that Shammi Kapoor was not helped in any way by his elder brother Raj Kapoor when he was trying to make his career as a romantic hero. Shammi Kapoor was a self-made person. Here despite all the support from Gulshan Kumar, Krishan Kumar could not create a Shammi Kapoor of Teesri Manzil here. The shoes of the legendary romantic hero proved to be too big for him. He appears to overact a lot while trying to copy the style of Shammi Kapoor (and falling flat on his face in this bid). Designer clothes and borrowed style cannot convert a crow into a swan. This movie could not establish Krishan Kumar as a durable hero in the industry but benefited him in a different way. Romance bloomed between himself and Taanya Singh during the making of this movie and Taanya went ahead to become Krishan Kumar&apos;s wife in due course of time."",""reviewRating""","[""Romance""]","""1993-09-17""","{""total"":0","""2H42M""",29.0

In most films of this kind, Kapoor would meet a smart sophisticated woman who would change his life. Here, the twist is that it&apos;s his friendship with a man that carries the narrative. And it is a weird friendship at that - Kapoor is a policeman who befriends an imprisoned criminal named Khan. The latter actually uses Kapoor&apos;s innocence to escape from jail by emotionally manipulating through fake stories. A middle-aged Raj Kapoor looks like Kader Khan looked in the 1990s - he plays the role with sincerity and inevitably attracts empathy from the viewers. The devious prisoner is played by a very young Shatrughan Sinha, who is good but loud. Now to the film itself, Khaan Dost is a very poor movie, almost unwatchable to be frank, and I wonder what made Kapoor take up this role at this stage of his career when he was hardly acting in movies and his production house did so well. The story is highly melodramatic and sentimental, and the director just can&apos;t make it cohere and resonate with a thinking viewer. A shame because had it been handled by a better director, this story could have been made into a much more absorbing human story."",""reviewRating""","[""Action"",""Crime"",""Drama""]","""1976-03-23""","{""total"":0","""2H37M""",46.0

He hires a personal photographer who soon becomes the reason for his downfall."",""","""Shakti Samanta&apos;s &apos;Ayaash&apos; is a period piece that takes place in 1930s India (when it was still ruled by the British). This was also the time that marked the downfall of the Zameendars (powerful property owners). &apos;Ayaash&apos; focuses on one such Zameendar Thakur Jaswant Singh. Thakur is a carefree alcoholic who avoids responsibility as he constantly preoccupies himself with booze and women while his accountant, lawyer and employees slowly continue to rob him of his riches. Enter a young photographer (hired by Thakur) Amal who is shocked by Thakur&apos;s ways. Thakur befriends him but this would mean that Amal would have to embrace Thakur&apos;s ways. Things become more complicated when Amal discovers that his ex-girlfriend is married to Thakur.\n\nIn terms of execution, &apos;Ayaash&apos; is nothing outstanding. The interiors of Thakur&apos;s mansion and costumes are quite lavish. Songs are too many. The first half actually required some editing as its flooded with one mujrah song after another. The film also focuses too much on the relationship between Thakur and Amal in the first half. The story is less predictable in the second half but it heavily rushes through the growing up of Thakur&apos;s son and his descension to his father&apos;s ways.\n\nSanjeev Kumar is amazing in a negative role. As the laidback Thakur, he shows a tenderness and gentle side but he&apos;s also pathologically stubborn. His torment in the later sequences when he discovers his wife&apos;s locket is portrayed brilliantly. Rati Agnihotri and Arun Govil are very good too.\n\nDespite being very flawed&apos;Ayaash&apos; is strays away from the formula of the typical 80&apos;s Bollywood flicks.

The three pals me..."",""","""This is a charming romantic comedy about six young adults, presumably fresh out of college or around that age. There are three current male friends, Sanjay (Aslam Khan), Vinod (Aman Sondhi) and Deepak (Vikas Kalantri), and three females who were friends at one time but who have lost touch with each other, Neela (Mallika Kapur), Shree (Jonita Doda) and Sherry (Divya Palat).\n\nSanjay runs a successful business, even if they have products that are a bit odd and questionable, such a match that self-ignites into a small bonfire when exposed to air. He&apos;s maybe the equivalent of a young, Indian Ron Popeil. Vinod is an up and coming cricket player. He&apos;s successful enough to be on his way to a rewarding career, but not yet successful enough to pay his rent on time, so he&apos;s been hiding from his landlord and using his window as an entrance/exit point from his apartment. Deepak is a fine but unusual singer who likes to combine traditional Indian music with modern pop. His neighbors aren&apos;t quite so fond of his constant practicing at home, especially since he also plays drums in his apartment.\n\nAs for the women, only one is shown having a career--Sherry, who is a successful field reporter for Toofani, a television program or station. Neela is the daughter of Vinod&apos;s landlord, and Shree lives in an apartment across the hall from Deepak. All three are beautiful, of course.\n\nThe gist of the film is that the three men inadvertently end up being mistaken for each other by the three women. Sanjay tries to talk to Vinod&apos;s landlord, and Neela thinks he&apos;s the cricket player. Deepak goes to talk to Sanjay and sits in his executive chair just as Sherry is coming in to interview the company head about his controversial matches. And Shree knocks on Deepak&apos;s door to encourage his singing. She&apos;s never met Deepak before, and Vinod answers instead. Maybe needless to say, the three couples, with the mistaken identity males, all fall head over heels in love with each other on first sight. This is made more complicated by the fact that Neela has a cricket player fetish, Sherry has a successful businessman fetish, and Shree has a singer fetish. So our male heroes cannot reveal the truth without risking their desired women. This leads to a lot of hilarious scenes in which they try to pass as each other, even though they have no talent or knowledge of the other&apos;s skills.\n\nEven furthering complicating things, there is a comic relief thug/terrorist villain, Tunda Bhai (Rajpal Yadav), who is obsessed with all three women (presumably he met them in school or something--it&apos;s never stated directly). Along with his equally buffoonish sidekick, he tries various schemes to win their love and vanquish his competition, including hiring a hilarious Pakistani terrorist, who arrives with his &quot;lucky Fiat&quot; in tow on top of a bus.\n\nThe plot may sound overly complex--this is one of the longest plot descriptions I&apos;ve written yet--but as long as you pay attention to the film, it&apos;s remarkably easy to follow. For regular viewers of Bollywood films, it might be even easier, as according to &quot;Indiatimes Movies&quot;, which basically trashed this film in their review, the plot is a bit clichéd at this point. I haven&apos;t seen nearly enough Bollywood films yet to say whether Dil Bechara Pyaar Ka Maara would be clichéd, but whether the plot bears some similarity to other films shouldn&apos;t affect your rating unduly. Dil Bechara Pyaar Ka Maara, like any other film, isn&apos;t better or worse as an artwork just because it&apos;s original or lacks originality. Aspects of similarity such as plot, if common enough, merely turn into genres eventually anyway.\n\nFor example, I&apos;m a huge horror film fan. There is no shortage of films that follow what is known as the &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; plot. That is, you take a sizable group of people, isolate them in some way (in a haunted house, on an island, in the woods, etc.) and gradually have a villain kill them off, one by one, until only one or two protagonists are left who do battle with the villain and (usually) defeat him, at least until the sequel arrives. A film that follows a Ten Little Indians plot line isn&apos;t worse for being clichéd in that way. It can still be a great film, as long as it&apos;s artistically rewarding/entertaining in some way, including performances, cinematography, clever, subtle twists on the expectations created by the Ten Little Indians plot line, and so on.\n\nDil Bechara Pyaar Ka Maara is a very good film artistically. It&apos;s frequently laugh-out-loud funny, the cast is talented and attractive, there are entertaining side characters like the Pakistani terrorist who traveled all that way to just help a fellow criminal in his love problems, the music is good (I especially loved the classical/modern blend of Deepak&apos;s songs), the choreography is consistently inventive/creative, and it is filled with interesting cinematography--even employing such unusual techniques as the superfast zoom in/zoom out style that was so popular back in the late 1960s/early 1970s in psychedelic music videos and films influenced by the same. It also has a pretty important theme about appreciating people for themselves, for whatever they happen to be, rather than seeing them as a particular career holder, or putting stringent restrictions on what you&apos;ll allow them to be.\n\nIt may not be a masterpiece, and maybe I&apos;d enjoy it even more if it were a bit less predictable overall, but really, that goes for the great majority of Bollywood films. Presumably, you wouldn&apos;t be considering watching a film like Dil Bechara Pyaar Ka Maara if you didn&apos;t like the typical Bollywood style, and as long as you enjoy that, you should find this film entertaining enough to at least give it one viewing."",""reviewRating""", , , , ,18.0

Quite unknown to him, Suraj has survived and is living with Deepak&apos;s mom. Years later, Mrs. Roy is thrilled when ..."",""","""Bollywood filmmakers have hackneyed certain plots to the hilt being under the impression that the Indian public likes the movies based on them and hence they are a proved way to succeed on the box office with the potboiler containing all the time tested formulae. One such plot is an imposter&apos;s taking place of a wealthy person in his household for the purpose of usurping his wealth. Another such plot is reincarnation of a murder-victim to seek revenge from the killer. Several movies have been made on these two plots. Dharkan(1972) contains a combination of them.\n\nThe movie starts with a criminal&apos;s seeking shelter in the house of a benevolent person. This criminal is Kewal Sharma(Roopesh Kumar) who is being chased by both the public and the police. The kind and benevolent person giving shelter and protection to him is a painter - Deepak Roy(I don&apos;t know the name of that actor). Suddenly Deepak happens to read about his childhood friend Suraj(Sanjay) in the newspaper and is very much delighted to know that his friend is alive. He then tells Kewal that he actually belongs to a rich family and in his childhood, he had accidentally shot his friend Suraj and then considering his friend as dead, had run away from the house. Now having come to know the truth, Deepak plans his homecoming and informs his widow mother and his long lost friend about that. He takes his retainer Kewal also with him and starts the journey to his native place by train. However when the train reaches its destination, the audience sees that the person who meets Deepak&apos;s mother and Suraj is actually Kewal who calls himself as Deepak. Well, the audience can guess what must have happened between the start of that journey and the end of that.\n\nKewal now usurps the whole business and property as Deepak. He also snatches the love of Suraj&apos;s life - Rekha(Mumtaaz) and marries her. He reduces Suraj&apos;s status from that of his friend to his ordinary employee and treats badly not only Rekha but also Deepak&apos;s mother. After a few years, when Rekha&apos;s father(living in Bombay) is dead, she brings her younger brother Dobby(Master Alankar) to his marital home. Gradually all the residents of that place including Suraj, Rekha and Kewal&apos;s widow mother are surprised to see that Dobby is not only totally familiar with everything there but also knows many such things about Deepak&apos;s life which he is not supposed to know. The truth comes out when Suraj takes little Dobby to a hypnotist. His friend Darshan(Rajendra Naath) who is a cop, also accompanies them. Now despite knowing the truth, Suraj and Darshan are facing the trouble to prove it before the law so that the culprit can be booked. Shortly Kewal also realizes as to who Dobby actually is. The climax, as expected, takes the baddie to his ultimate destination.\n\nThe script of this movie has been written very well by blending the story of the imposter&apos;s evil deed with the reincarnation drama covering the revenge of the victim. However director Devendra Goel has faltered in his job of presenting this interesting story on the screen in the perfect manner. He could have presented it as a suspense story but he decided to allow the audience to know the truth from the beginning itself. Still he has tried to create some suspense through the police investigation and an unresolved case which lingers on with the police for years but this effort of his has finally fallen flat on its face. Hence though the curiosity remains for the audience as to how the truth will come out and be proved, there is nothing like suspense. Reincarnation issue also remains known to the spectators much before it is revealed by the narrator.\n\nThe biggest minus point of this movie is the villain. The story has been narrated in such a way that the character of the villain gets the maximum footage and attention in the narrative. Roopesh Kumar was never considered a good actor and barring a couple of movies, he always did nautanki in the name of acting. He has done the same during the major part of this movie also especially during the last one hour. \n\nStill the movie is interesting and a decent one time watch. The rom-com part of the story is able to amuse and entertain the audience in a satisfactory way. The sequence in which the hero awaits the heroine and during the wait finds himself lost in the advertisements being telecast on radio, dreaming himself as well as the heroine(with their would be child) as the characters of the advertisements, is damn hilarious. \n\nSanjay(Khan) was a chocolaty hero of his time and his looks as well as acting are pretty charming. Mumtaaz has done well as the heroine. The supporting cast including the actor in the role of the original Deepak Roy are well in place. Rajendra Naath is not just a comedian in the movie, his role is that of a no-nonsense dutiful cop during the final part of the movie and he has done well alongside Helen, his sweetheart who is a pickpocket. The best actor in this movie is undoubtedly Master Alankar as the little Dobby who impresses in every scene of his.\n\nRavi&apos;s music is overall good. Two songs stand out - one is Mere Dost Tujhe Tera Meet Mubaarak in Rafi&apos;s voice which the hero sings when the love of his life gets married to his friend whereas the one is a splendid journey song in Kishore Kumar&apos;s voice - Main To Chala Jidhar Chale Rasta, a song pretty close to my heart.\n\nSumming up, despite flaws and weaknesses, this potboiler of the seventies is a nice timepass."",""reviewRating""", , , , ,50.0

Inspired by a true story."",""","""Winner at few and selected for more film festivals abroad, this is the second film post I AM KALAAM which puts me in a big confusion about the selection procedure followed by these film festivals. Honestly, I can think of only two reasons, why such simple yet ineffective films can reach these festivals abroad representing India.\n\nOne – Probably there are too many big &amp; small film festivals being organized all over the world who are short of films and are ready to accept all kind of entries in their contest, irrespective of their content, especially from India for its universal global fame.\n\nAnd Two – It seems that there is not enough choice with the festival jury abroad regarding the films coming from India, which can be called perfect for the festival circuit. And therefore they are forced to include whatever they actually have on the table just to add India&apos;s name in their brochure.\n\nAs per my understanding, a festival nominee or winner should expectedly be a film with some out of the box thought structure, shocking subject or treatment like we had in UDAAN which came in 2010. But here in YEH KHULA AASMAAN we don&apos;t have any such out of the routine subject matter or execution which makes you feel great in the end. The film starts off promisingly showing the result and exams stress on a young boy who is not getting the much needed attention from his parents living abroad. Yet it fails to sustain the meaningful impact and then goes on to become an unexciting sports film talking about a forgotten sport of Kite Flying.\n\nThe plot which should have been used by the director Gitanjali Sinha to impart many precious life teaching lessons through the interaction between the boy and his grandfather actually goes flat in absence of any well written thoughtful scenes. The same can be said for the inclusion of Kite Flying added in the second half to showcase a heritage sport of India, still famous in its smaller cities. In fact I doubt that is what might have been the reason for the film&apos;s entry into the various festivals abroad.\n\nIn short, YKA has only three merits in its favour. It has a soothing cinematography capturing the village locales, some well sung songs (lacking the melody) and an impactful performance of Raghuveer Yadav which forces you to keep watching it till the end. Otherwise it has few amateur performances from the youngsters and one big miscast, Yashpal Sharma in the role of a foreign settled entrepreneur. No doubt, simplicity has its own beauty....but YEH KHULA AASMAAN remains too simple to be applauded from start to finish (lacking the beauty part) and therefore I would not be able to recommend it despite of many festival references given on its posters. So you can easily skip it to be watched on any TV Channel after a few months."",""reviewRating""","[""Family""]","""2012-05-25""","""journey""", ,10.0

The acting is also contained and the dialogues are to the point and revelatory. There is a sensitivity and sensuality to the film that is otherwise lacking in Indian cinema. One starts feeling for the two central characters from the very start of the film. There is no unnecessary heroism neither is there any useless sentimentality. Anil Dhawan is okay. Perhaps the best film of his non-illustrious career. But Rehana Sultan is a sweetheart as Seema. She carries out her role with an elan in the first half and a pathos in the second which was quite a surprise for me to find in Bollywood films. Hardly ever such detailed and nuanced characters are written for women in Indian cinema. One can even say that it is a woman centric film. But it climaxes to a place that elevates the narrative to a higher point. Must watch for anyone who looks for more than just entertainment in cinema. I am going to check out other works of B.S.

Gillo Pontecorvo&apos;s `Algiers&apos; shows the decade leading to that liberation in a powerful story about Muslims asserting their rights through violence, hiding, and plotting in the Kasbah, a demiworld of narrow, winding, seemingly endless alleys that are the only protection the rebels have from the eyes of the French.  The re-release of the 1965 black and white film is a convincing story of a people who do not want to be occupied and will give their lives so their families can one day be free.\n\nThe story centers on a couple of Muslim leaders, the charismatic Col. of the French forces, and the bombings and shootouts that at one point averaged just over 4 per day. The film&apos;s sympathy is for the Muslims, but the Colonel has moments of reflection that could be sympathetic, especially with the revelation that he was a member of the resistance in WWII and may have suffered in a concentration camp. The director shows the influence of Italian neo-realists like Roberto Rossellini (`Paisan&apos;) by shooting in documentary style on location, using non-actors (except for the Colonel), and generally avoiding an agitprop angle.\n\nBut the film&apos;s sympathy in the end belongs to the occupied people.  When 3 rebel women change appearance to look French, infiltrate, and plant bombs, the irony obvious to American audiences in their current struggle is a tribute to the strength of the narration and characterization and the universal dislike of occupation and subjugation.\n\nThe torture of the Muslim prisoners is the most poignant relevance to the recent scandal in Iraq.  The Colonel&apos;s justification for the practice to gain life-saving information is classic `ends-justify-the-means&apos; logic still being used by great nations. In fact, the Pentagon reportedly had seen this film during the first days of the second Iraq War; some say they learned nothing from the film, which is an unforgettable study of occupation and defeat.""},""aggregateRating""","[""Drama"",""War""]","""1966-09-09""","""battle of algiers,torture,algeria,resistance,struggle for independence""","""2H1M""",56.0

Due to his honesty, he gets in the wrong side of Seth Dharamdas (Raj Mehra), who conspires with Vidyanand&apos;s pupil, Shyam Rao (Anoop Kumar), and has him sent t..."",""","""Aansoo Ban Gaye Phool (1969) revolves around Ashok Kumar, the principal of a college, being a man of principles in his life and career, very firm on his ideals and never scared of calling a spade a spade. He and his doctor wife, Nirupa Roy have lost their only son long back and now to them, the students of the college only are like their own children. Ashok Kumar comes across a carefree but talented and self-made student of the college, Dev Mukherjee who is an orphan. Ashok Kumar guides and inspires him to become a man of ideals and principles in his life. However Ashok Kumar himself is framed in corruption charges by the corrupt owner of the college with the help of Ashok Kumar&apos;s younger brother Anoop Kumar. Being backstabbed by his own brother, Ashok Kumar feels disenchanted with his ideals and upon release from jail after his sentence is over, he resorts to unlawful activities with the help of his trusted old buddy Pran and his wife Helen. He stays away from his wife Nirupa Roy who has not left the path of piety and rightness. But one day he is stunned to see his beloved student, Dev Mukherjee on the other side of the things, in a police inspector&apos;s uniform. Dev catches Pran and Helen for their unlawful activities without being aware of the master brain behind them. Seeing his comrades arrested, Ashok Kumar&apos;s man of ideals sleeping within him for the past many years. wakes up and he surrenders to Dev, confessing his crimes. Dev is taken aback to see his role model and mentor as a criminal and he performs his duty of arresting him amongst tears. The ending scene justifies the title of the movie too - Aansoo Ban Gaye Phool (tears turned into flowers).\n\nThe story is very impressive and engrossing till the interval. However it lets down after the interval when Ashok Kumar chooses the wrong path after completing his prison sentence. Again it catches the viewer in a bit prolonged climax and leaves a lasting impression on his heart. The first half an hour of the movie contains laughs also through the innocent activities and gestures of Dev Mukherjee. The song picturised on him and others in the election compaign for the student association post - Ab Chaahe Kisi Se Pyar Karo, Inko Vote Do - is very much entertaining to listen to and to watch as well. The scene picturised on Ashok Kumar and Dev Mukherjee when Dev Mukherjee spends a night in Ashok Kumar&apos;s house after a violent encounter with the college bully, leading to his arrest and release on the security of Ashok Kumar, is in my opinion, one of the best Bollywood scenes related to teacher-student interaction. That scene left an indelible impression upon my heart and I consider that as the essence of this movie. One more scene which is very impressive and touching is the scene of Ashok Kumar&apos;s staging a scene showing him in proximity of Helen, to repel his pious wife Nirupa Roy from him because now their paths take opposite directions.\n\nThe movie mainly belongs to Ashok Kumar and he, right from as the idealist education-man in the first half to a harsh criminal in the second half, has delivered excellently; carrying the whole movie on his shoulders. Another protagonist in the movie is Dev Mukherjee, a confused youth, who does not understand which path he should adopt in his life until Ashok Kumar scolds him for his confusion and shows him the way. In the first half, he is charming and lovable, enjoying in the college and romancing with the pretty heroine, Alka. In the second half, he has not got much footage but the climax gives him a chance to showcase his talent and mettle which he exploits to the optimum.\n\nThe character of Pran as Ashok Kumar&apos;s jolly-nature buddy who is never hesitant to do the wrong things for money, has been very well developed. They are very close friends despite the fact that Ashok Kumar is highly righteous and honest as against the &apos;do it for money&apos; type Pran and their chemistry is hilarious with Pran making a different mark with his mannerisms. The character of Helen as Pran&apos;s wife is also very well crafted. It was a big surprise for the audience to see Helen clad in a saari in that time of the sixties. She is shown as completely dedicated to her husband, supporting him in every hour and every activity of life. The role of Nirupa Roy as the kind-hearted doctor who sticks to the right path even after her husband&apos;s wrong arrest and consequential disenchantment with virtues, is also well-designed. All these three have done exceedingly well. Alka, who is in romantic lead with Dev Mukherjee has nothing much to do.\n\nThe music of the movie composed by Laxmikant Pyarelal is good. It contains only four songs out of which I have already praised - Ab Chaahe Kisi Se Pyar Karo, Inko Vote do. Jaane Kaisa Hai Mera Deewana is a great romantic song and my all time favourite. \n\nThe significance of this movie can be understood through two points ", , , ,"""2H25M""",53.0

Both fall for the same man (Shashi Kapoor), and that&apos;s how the story follows this conflict.\n\nThe highlights of the film are the two leading ladies who perform convincingly. This gives the film a new charm not warranted by the ordinary, flawed script. Raakhee plays a 30 plus woman who is widely known to be difficult to deal with, and this is realised when she forms her first relationship with the first man in her life. Her character is jealous, manipulative, domineering and even obsessed, and the actress displays all these features quite well. Rati&apos;s role is that of a beautiful, gentle, supportive and sacrificing woman, who is both vulnerable and strong. She plays her character effectively. Shashi Kapoor performs well as always, but disappears in a role that is not demanding nor particularly pivotal.\n\nAll in all, a nice, warm film with a tragic ending.

Then I understood, that era has ended with the era of the greats. \n\nThis is a simple thriller and the narrative is linear. Safecracker Ravi (Jeetendra), who works as a freelancer to help companies improve their safe designing, somehow gets involved in a terrible crime with Robert (Danny Denzongpa) in an attempt to help a woman Julie (Padma Khanna). He runs away from the city to a remote hilly area to become manager in an woods estate owned by (Satyen Kappu), and his daughter, Reena (Saira Banu). Everything goes well and he falls in love with Reena, improves the prospects of the estate and manages everything to the best of his capacity - until the day Robert lands at his doorstep. He wants Ravi to crack a safe, and a refusal means he will divulge his crimes to the local cops. Watch the movie to know what happens next. \n\nA fantastic script by Salim-Javed means 2 hrs 25 minutes fly by. Jeetendra is spot-on in his act, and Danny turns in another excellent villainous act. Watch the scene where Jeetu punches Danny and he rises from the ground and warns him never to do this again. Simply a class act. \n\nJeetu fits the role like a glove and is aided ably by the beautiful, charming and slightly comical Saira Banu. Padma Khanna is amazing too, and Iftekar is best in yet another cop act. The rest of the cast, comprising of Satyen Kappu, Ramesh Deo and Ranjeet, are excellent. \n\nI am taking out two stars for the inferior music. Only the track Aisa Na Hoke In Waadiyon Me by Mohammed Rafi stands out. The rest by LP are really average compositions. Stronger music would have made this thriller a perfect 10. Direction by A. Salaam is fabulous and tight. Production values (M.M. Malhotra) are fantastic. Watch it at night, and you will love to revisit the movie.

And any review of the film would be incomplete without mentioning the absolutely marvellous performance by Motilal, as Mr Sampat, a sleek, smooth operator who perhaps was way too real and deviously clever for 50s cinema. In any case, the movie itself is totally different from the established mould of 50s Bombay cinema. Others have done a decent job too. The satirical spirit even engulfs the song and dance sequences, some of which are equally biting as the rest of the plot.

Today I am reviewing a long forgotten black and white Bollywood movie which is a suspense-thriller whose story has been written with the involvement of the effects of full moon on people&apos;s behaviour patterns. It&apos;s Poonam Ki Raat (1965) directed by Kishore Sahu who had directed many good movies from the early forties to the early seventies and also acted in a few movies (In Dev Anand&apos;s classic movie - Guide, Kishore Sahu had played the role of Marco, Waheeda Rehman&apos;s husband).\n\nPoonam Ki Raat (full moon night) starts with the hostelled student life of the hero, Manoj Kumar and his college-mate (and hostel-mate), Shiv Kumar. Due to the news of the paralytic attack on Shiv Kumar&apos;s father (D.K. Sapru), he had to rush to his home with Manoj Kumar accompanying him. After entering the city, when they are yet to reach Shiv Kumar&apos;s home, Manoj Kumar happens to overhear some talks (on a roadside shop) related to the death of a woman Rani who was considered to be the keep of Shiv Kumar&apos;s father. She had died mysteriously on a full moon night. After reaching Shiv Kumar&apos;s home, Manoj Kumar gets introduced to all of his family members and effortlessly comes to know of the property related intrigues and conspiracies spread in that joint family. The very first, yet very romantic encounter with Shiv Kumar&apos;s sister, Kumud Chhugani leads to blossoming of love between herself and Manoj Kumar. However there&apos;s a lot more for him to see and feel in that house.\n\nIn the night, he happens to hear a mystery-filled song (Saathi Re, Tujh Bin Jiya Udaas Re) being sung by a female. However when he tries to locate that singer, he is able to find none. Moreover, this is not the only mysterious incident in the house. Many mysterious and not understandable things are taking place, mostly in the night hours. The gestures of certain members of the family are no less mysterious than the incidents. And then, the already paralytic and bed-ridden aged father sees something horrible in the night and falls from the cot. Resultantly, his paralytic condition gets worsened and he loses his power to speak too. Simultaneously, the nurse who has been hired to take care of him (being a resident nurse) goes missing. Her dead body is found from a well in the house after a couple of days. These events have also taken place on a full moon night only. Manoj Kumar&apos;s own behaviour is also getting abnormal day-by-day (due to living in such an environment). The family doctor (Kishore Sahu) who had deputed the nurse to take care of the old man, is approached by Shiv Kumar to understand something about abnormal people because he suspects that his friend Manoj Kumar is actually insane and he only has committed the murder of the nurse. The mystery is finally unfolded when another eventful full moon night arrives.\n\nThe mystery of this story starts with the beginning of the movie itself but it is spread quite gradually and the director has taken his time in enveloping the viewer in the mysterious web of the things lying scattered in the script. However, the way the storyline moves, albeit at a slow pace, it proves to be an engrossing suspense-filled experience for a mystery-fan. The spectator finds himself as lost in some fog or mist which clears only in the climax. Despite songs, romance and hilarious sequences being placed in the movie, finally it&apos;s the suspense only which prevails throughout. Thus Poonam Ki Raat can justifiably be called a pure mystery. The climax is not something like action-packed. It may appear to be dry for the typical Indian audience who have got habituated to see a high profile climax. However the climax is thoughtful and logically explains every particle of the mystery. I award full marks to the director for that.\n\nSince it&apos;s mainly an in-house drama, the production value did not need to be high. However the cinematographer has ably maintained the mysterious environment throughout this black and white movie. If the camera work is efficient, the suspense can be exasperated better in a black and white movie than in a coloured movie. Poonam Ki Raat proves it. Otherwise also, the movie is technically good.\n\nSalil Chowdhary has prepared good music for this suspense movie. Saathi Re, Tujh Bin Jiya Udaas Re is a famous suspense song of Lata Mangeshkar. Other songs - Bhole Piya, Tum Kahaan Le Chale Ho, Sapno Mein Mere, Ta Deem Tana Deem and Dil Tadpe Tadpaaye are also quite good. The music director has aptly used the voices of Mukesh, Rafi and the Mangeshkar sisters (Lata, Asha and Usha) for different songs.\n\nPerformances are not great but not bad either. It&apos;s the debut movie of the heroine, Kumud Chhugani and she looks charming and innocent. Among others, if someone really stands out, it&apos;s Leela Mishra who plays the role of the sister of the head of the house.\n\nPriyadarshan&apos;s so-called horror movie - Bhool Bhulaiya (2007) is more or less on similar lines only. Since Poonam Ki Raat is a long forgotten movie and not known to today&apos;s generation, nobody has contrasted Bhool Bhulaiya with it to find out glaring similarities between these two movies (with the sole exception of yours truly). One more illustration of plagiarism ! Who cares ? However this black and white movie is far better than Bhool Bhulaiya because it explains everything happening in the movie in a perfectly logical way in the climax which is not the case with Priyadarshan&apos;s movie.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Poonam Ki Raat to the audience of suspense-thrillers."",""reviewRating""", , , ,"""2H16M""",57.0

Probably this is why this movie had not takers.\n\nSilly lines like the ones mentioned in the message boards do not help in making the movie engrossing either.\n\nThe plot is actually a combinations of sub plots taken from other Ramesh Behl movies like Kasme Vaade (errant young man + understanding elder), Jawani Diwani (son is a gunda and does hungama in college) as well as other subjects shown in movies like Zameen Asman where the other woman develops maternal feelings for the hero&apos;s son.\n\nWhat drew to me to the movie however was mind blowing numbers from Pancham. &quot;Tune kiya kya jadoo&quot;, &quot;Idhar bhi tu&quot; are treasures."",""reviewRating""", , , , ,35.0

In these dark situations, where one surely gives up ..."",""","""An unknown film with a strange unusual title, a strong visible print promotion and many new names in its credits were enough to put me in the obvious doubts. But still, I was ready to give it a chance since I am always eager to get surprised from any of these relatively small ventures which may turn out to be the dark horse of the race any Friday. But unfortunately CIGARETTE KI TARAH is not anywhere close to that and it remains one of those ambitious projects made with an amateurish confident attitude without any basic vision or skill.\n\nIn most of the cases, such films always choose a &apos;Crime-Thriller&apos; kind of subject for its basic storyline since it easily gives them the opportunity to add all the essential commercial elements into the film ranging from friendship, betrayal, conspiracy, murder, suspense, chase, love and sex. Now playing it safe the makers of CKT also do the same but in the process are not able to give you even a single scene rising above the mediocre level resulting in a pretty bad product in the end. The film begins with a chase sequence and as it progresses showcasing many weak, vague &amp; unrelated scenes, one clearly gets an idea that it is going to be real hard to tolerate this amateurish attempt for the next two hours.\n\nConfusingly moving between Kanpur and Goa, the first time director Akashaditya Lamadesperately tries every trick of the trade to establish his lead actor Bhoop Yaduvanshi as a hero, in vain. And if the boy is really interested in this tough world of acting then he seriously needs to give it a second thought or try something else. Walking on the same lines, Yuvika Chaudhary also disappoints hugely, who surprisingly looked quite charming in her small cameo in Shahrukh Khan&apos;s OM SHANTI OM. Sudesh Berry hams in his every scene but the debutant Madhurima Tulli thankfully gives the viewer something to see on the screen in comparison to others. So we have only one serious actor in here as Prashant Narayanan who also looks too casual suggesting his lack of interest in the project.\n\nThe cinematography of CKT gives you the feeling of a trial video being shot and the same can be said about its background score and soundtrack with some below average tracks. In simple words, either the producers here were too over-confident about their own instincts &amp; so called passion for cinema or they unknowingly hired a less experienced and unprofessional team which was able to give them such a low grade product in return.\n\nTo be honest, I just had one thought in my mind while watching its end credits rolling and it was the way Late JASPAL BHATTI used to boldly write in all his ventures as &quot;Misdirected by Jaspal Bhatti&quot;. However where the renowned comic writer-director fondly used the term as an intelligent sarcasm, CIGARETTE KI TARAH suits the term perfectly as a &apos;T&apos; since its nothing but just another misdirected project backed by some energetic producers."",""reviewRating""","[""Romance"",""Thriller""]","""2012-12-14""","""cigarette""","""1H47M""",10.0

Obviously it belongs to Hema Malini, who plays a very common role for her own good. It&apos;s a sort variation of Basanti from Sholay, Shanno from Raja Jani - an illiterate young woman who meets an urban, highly sophisticated young man and falls in love with him. This time it&apos;s Jeetendra, and unlike Malini, he plays against type a very measured, calm man with a big heart. The chemistry between the two is pretty good, but more than anything, this little-known film actually has a very good script, and it&apos;s a great watch for Hindi movie buffs. While, quite expectedly, we get some highly familiar plot elements revealed by the end of the story, I was more engaged by its humorous delivery.\n\nThe film works as a full-on comedy, and due credit goes to Hema Malini who plays to the gallery with aplomb. Her Ramkali is streetsmart and feisty but also quite slow-witted and even a little dumb, and Malini, never shy of ridiculing herself on-screen, is affectionately enjoyable, providing many laughs all through. That we see a different side of hers later on is only to her benefit. The entire track of turning Ramkali into a princess is quite fun, indeed. Jeetendra is very good as her leading man whose kind patience appears to have limits, too. Support is good from Amjad Khan and Shreeram Lagoo, among others, and the film has some nice songs from Ravindra Jain, particularly &quot;Naacho Re&quot;.

The film&apos;s first half is absolutely fantastic, interestingly narrating the love story between Ravi and Bittu. He is a theatre actor who moonlights as a TV repairman, and she is quite a spoiled brat, daughter to a wealthy businessman who raised her by himself and she is thus quite the typical daddy&apos;s girl. The film stars Jackie Shroff in one of his early films and Khushboo as the girl. Shroff is one of my favourites, and he does full justice to the part. He always brings something realistic to his parts, and this one is no exception. The film, however, belongs to the very young Khushboo, who is pretty and natural and who is that rare combination of both youthful, innocent charm and ladylike sophistication. Their romance is beautiful, but then the second half turns the entire story into a melodrama. I&apos;m not saying this is necessarily bad, by the way. At first I identified several similarities between this film and Hrishikesh Mukherjee&apos;s classic Mili, which might have inspired the director, but ultimately this is a different film. Rati Agnihotri, Anupam Kher, Saeed Jaffrey, and Sulabha Deshpande, all do well in supporting roles. The film is presented as a love triangle on this website, which is clearly not the case.

Women are only the machine of fulfilling sexual needs and producing child!!! This myth has protested by a woman itself in director Dedipya Joshi&apos;s &apos;Shackle&apos;. Standing in Twenty First century when we are talking about women empowerment, many women are still being driven in the dark. Till date women have to sacrifice her life in the sake of despicable social rituals. \n\nIn &apos;Shackle&apos; 26 years old beautiful and educated Abeera is the victim of her villagers&apos; own rituals and taboos. The dream of her marriage broke when she was forced to get married to almost a kid of 11 years old Keshar. The pure love, an unknown bonding and a beautiful chemistry between the unmatched couple Abeera and Keshar has breathtakingly picturised by director Dedipya Joshi. But how a fairy-tale can exist in such a tabooed society? Abeera and Keshar&apos;s love story also stands in the face of question when friends make fun of young Keshar about the relationship between Keshar and his four years old daughter Guddia. But Keshar totally gets bolt from the blue when he came to know that the bad egg between he and Abeera was none other than his own father. To save his ladylove from the dreadful situation Keshar&apos;s silent protest to his father has exceptionally shown in the movie. Good time passes like New York minute. In the spur of a moment Keshar kills his father and arrested by the local police. The rest of the part of the movie is for the sake of love. How the two lovers fight with their destiny and how Abeera sacrifices her life to secure her daughter and other village women&apos;s future?\n\nAs a director it is always challenging to take such an uncommon topic and with shackle Dedipya Joshi undeniably passed with distinction. Apart from a social message &apos;Shackle&apos; is also a movie of relationship crisis. Shackle means something that confines one&apos;s legs and arms or something that checks or prevents one&apos;s free action. By taking such an eccentric topic director has made justice to the title of the movie. Through this uncommon and arresting movie he has brilliantly shown the pain and anguish of women in rural India.\n\nDirector has selected a very unusual casts for very unusual roles and each actor has made such a fair play to their character that one can easily connect. Rich compositions &amp; background music are mostly situation-based and aid the narrative.

When his dad unexpectedly passes away, he wills that all his wealth and money will only be inherit..."",""","""Ek Naya Rishta is one of the most daring, bold, and unexpected films of its times. Vinod Pande is perhaps the most underrated filmmaker of commercial Hindi cinema of the 1980s. It was a sad decade for the mainstream Hindi film industry, where films hardly reflected the social state of the times, which was mostly tackled by art films which started gaining popularity because of the lack of meaningful commercial products but couldn&apos;t hold too much interest because the masses still needed entertainment. Among those directors who knew how to combine both the art, the commentary, and the glamour, was Pande, whose projects can be rightly termed as true middle-of-the-road, cinema. Ek Naya Rishta deals with a range of subjects not ever dealt with in mainstream Hindi films, including fear of commitment among urban youth, the search for independence and opportunities in the big city, and the underlying filth that&apos;s hidden in these big cities, which are laden with promiscuity, sometimes under the guise of art and culture, corruption and abuse of women in prostitution or surrogacy, and loneliness. And all these themes are dealt with so realistically, with great care and a nice touch of humour, in this beautiful romantic drama.\n\nThe film first presents the story of Rajiv, a young wealthy man who likes getting involved in different affairs with women but refuses to marry despite his father&apos;s many efforts to convince him. After his father&apos;s death, however, the will reads saying that Rajiv could only inherit the fortune on the condition that within 18 months he fathers his own biological son. Devastated at first, Rajiv soon comes up with a plan to find a woman who would agree to bear his child for money without having to marry her. Cut to the other side of the country, a young small-town woman named Aarti is leaving her house to try and make it big as an artist in the Bombay, trusting her boyfriend Vikram as her future manager. A few months later, Aarti leaves Vikram, with subsequent flashbacks revealing how she travelled to the big city only to be manipulated into prostitution, followed by her circumstantial foray into seemingly elite circles where beneath the polished surface, young girls are abused by people of power. When Aarti tries to get her life back together and looks for a job as a secretary, she catches the sight of Rajiv. Initially repulsed by his indecent proposal to mother his child for money, a letter from her mother about their financial state makes her reluctantly take up his offer. This is where the dark story takes its long-awaited turn and gradually takes the shape of a charming romance.\n\nEk Naya Rishta is indeed a very original and interesting story, and Pande makes the best of it. He directs it with heart and gives the film a sort of everyday realism through the characters, the dialogue, the setting, and the overall proceedings. The narrative style is dark and serene and very different from what one usually sees in mainstream Hindi films, and the overall feel is authentic. The film never resorts to cheap melodrama, and even the most difficult, dramatic portions are handled with restraint and delicacy. Some of the scenes showing Rajiv&apos;s house filled with greedy relatives wanting to take over the house provide nice comic relief, while Aarti&apos;s moments with herself, where she contemplates about her life, past and future, are done brilliantly. Pande actually manages to convey so much of her story through some brief scenes alone, often presented as unexpected plot twists in flashbacks, or insinuated through some of Aarti&apos;s conversations with her friend, providing hints of what is going on without revealing too much of what happened - a very rare respect for the viewers&apos; intelligence. Similarly, the depth of the relationships is really surprising - just one single scene captures the relationship between Aarti and her mother and brother in less than a minute. One striking sequence for me is in a hotel, seemingly used as a very fine social club for leisure, dance and dating, where behind an intellectual and cultured facade functions nothing but a regular, modern-day brothel", , , , ,34.0

As far as love is concerned, it may happen at any stage of a person&apos;s life. It is said that love just happens, not deliberately accomplished (Pyaar Kiya Nahin Jaata, Ho Jaata Hai). Hence whatever is your age or situation, you are destined to fall in love with someone of opposite sex, you can&apos;t do anything about it. You may not express your love to him or her but love for him or her is bound to exist in your heart.\n\nBut marriage ? Marriage is an altogether different business. Why ? Because marriage involves commitment, marriage calls for shouldering responsibility and marriage means a life-long association with the spouse. It is much more than love and hence marriage cannot just happen. It is to be carried out deliberately after investing a lot of thought in the decision. That&apos;s why, when a male or a female is past his / her reasonable age to enter into wedlock, the decision to marry someone is not that easy even when the concerned person is in love. You may be an eligible bachelor or an eligible maiden but if your age does not entitle you to be called a boy or a girl, then ? \n\nPrem Vivah (1979) is a family drama that deals with this issue. As the title suggests, the story involves both love (Prem) and marriage (Vivah). \n\nThe story deals with the life of four characters only. Asha Parekh and Bindiya Goswami are two unmarried sisters. Bindiya is quite young whereas Asha is well past her marriageable age. Their parents being dead long back, Asha has been more like a mother to Bindiya than her elder sister and for the sake of fostering her only, she had neglected the issue of her own marriage. Now Bindiya herself has attained marriageable age and she is in love with an eligible bachelor Mithun Chakraborty. The twist in the tale comes with the entry of a mature-age bachelor Utpal Dutt.\n\nUtpal Dutt who is almost double the age of Bindiya Goswami, comes across her and falls for her charms. However he is under a false impression that Bindiya also loves him whereas the fact is that Bindiya only respects him. Through Bindiya, he is introduced to her elder sister Asha Parekh. Now with his regularly meeting the sisters renders an impression to them that he is in love with Asha. Asha also starts liking him and starts dreaming to marry him when her younger sister ties the sacred knot with her beau. Misunderstandings continue and when the truth dawns upon the characters of this story, the issues has become too complicated to handle. Since Mithun Chakraborty has to move abroad after marrying Bindiya who is ambivalent due to being concerned for her elder sister; it&apos;s Utpal only who has to take a compromising decision to cope with this cruel jest that destiny has cracked on them, especially him.\n\nPersonally I believe and almost everybody will agree to it that if at all one has to marry, he / she should ensure that the marriage takes place at an appropriate age. However now the trend is that people continue to remain unmarried till they are in their thirties. Well, late marriages bring many problems with them but the other side of the picture is equally important. Since a majority of marriages in India are more or less a gamble with life (one may win, one may lose), if someone waits for Mr. Right or Miss Right, there is no harm because bachelorhood is a much better option that remaining unhappy after marriage and restlessly longing to break free from its shackles.\n\nThe second issue is the love emerging for someone who is much younger or much older in age. In this movie, mainly the complication is due to Utpal Dutt&apos;s attraction for a much younger Bindiya Goswami who cannot guess in the wildest of her dreams that Utpal visits their family for the sake of his love for her only and always remains under the impression that his feelings are for her elder sister who belongs to his age-group. Well, in my humble opinion, in such a situation, the concerned people should not allow any communication gap to creep in and give rise to misunderstandings. Communication gap is a highly undesirable thing when it comes to relationships. Straightforward talks should take place and everything should be clarified without a hitch, else things can go from bad to worse only.\n\nThe movie has been directed by Basu Chatterjee very well but being a serious movie, it&apos;s not the cup of tea of those who watch movies for fun. There remains an undercurrent of tension in the later half of the movie and this tension makes the movie burdensome. Only those who are able to relate to any of the characters and the situations shown, may find themselves as engrossed. Though the curiosity regarding the climax remains, it is more or less a forgone conclusion.\n\nThe narrative has been lifted by the admirable performances of the lead actors. All the four principal artists have delivered mature performances as per the demand of the story.\n\nAll in all, Prem Vivah deals with a significant issue but does not offer any solution. Even when a person (male or female) remains unmarried till his / her forties, the age does not affect the tender feelings for someone which may emerge at any stage of life because human-beings are bound to love because they need love for them too. However marriage may be performed as a compromise with life. In my opinion, the challenge which is much bigger that making this compromise, is to love the person whom you have married without love. It may prove to be a Herculean task but it is mandatory if the marital life is to survive."",""reviewRating""", , , , ,43.0

The film had one of the greatest screen pair, Sunil Dutt and Waheeda Rehman, who give powerful performances this time also. Besides, the film has brief but nice roles from Ashok Kumar, Jalaal Agha, Deb Mukherjee, and Fardia Jalaal too. Everything seems fine, but still the film doesn&apos;t work. The film was a major flop that time; and the reason seems obvious that it fails to captivate the interest. First the theme doesn&apos;t look very clear. It dwindles from caste system of the society, medical profession to a melodrama; and nowhere the focus remains sharp. There are also plenty of flaws in direction. For instance, Sunil Dutt&apos;s get up and looks remain constant despite the time period of 8 years when he grows from a student to an experienced doctor. His dialogue delivery was also constant throughout. The music and songs aren&apos;t memorable despite SD Burman&apos;s enchanting voice and music. Ramesh Dev&apos;s role was a wash out nor the cameo of Ashok Kumar was something brilliant. To appreciate, there were less of the formulaic sequences or flights from the regular &apos;70s flick. Overall, it&apos;s such film which though had big names and a good subject still doesn&apos;t work due to the poor film making.\n\nRating", , , , ,50.0

Obligatory villains do their bit to thwart good intentions.\n\nCan Aroo ever acknowledge his real mother as his own?\n\nThere are a few location sequences such as the Century Bazar in Worli, a couple of Versova shots and repetitive Kulu and Kashmir outdoors. Mostly shot in studios, the editing is good, camera work is a bit spotty, direction and acting is better than average. Dharmendra runs pretty much true to type. Hema Malini displays her versatility in playing the mother and the foster mother. In the view of this reviewer, she excels in the role of the biological mother.\n\nWorth watching - Bollywood in 2014 would not get away with some of the dialogues.

In any case, this is certainly not in the league of &apos;Dastak&apos; (1970), which Bedi directed himself. The storyline and subject matter are handled with competence, though the pace is a bit awkward and the numerous songs tend to dilute the dramatic intensity. The sudden mood swings and behavioral changes of the central character are at times mystifying and actors are often called on to perform hysterically. At other times, the performances are grounded and subtle, as per the milieu.

When I had read about it (prior to watching), I was thinking it to be on the lines of more than a decade old Akshay Khanna-Sonali Bendre Starrer Dahek (1999) on account of its being a tragic love story of a Hindu boy and Muslim girl. However when I happened to watch Ishaqzaade, I felt that it&apos;s not on the lines of Dahek and the so-called honour-killing statement was unnecessary imposed on the narrative by the ending assertion. Actually, this way the writer-director, Habib Faisal tried to make a fool of the audience by showing off as if the movie were an exemplary one. Actually, had the lead pair of Ishaqzaade been belonging to the same religion, it would not have made any difference to the story. But then, I was getting a sense of deja vu also. The idea and certain incidents were appearing quite familiar to me while my eyes were on the screen. And when in the end, the boy and the girl ended their lives on the screen, putting an end to the story, I got illumination in my mind as to what&apos;s been the real inspiration behind this movie. It&apos;s a long forgotten movie - Ek Baar Chale Aao (1983).\n\nEk Baar Chale Aao (come just once please) starts with the unfortunate event of non-happening of marriage of the sister of Dharam Daas (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) because the groom, Deen Dayaal (Girish Karnaad) refuses to marry her because of non-payment of the agreed dowry amount by the bride&apos;s family. Dharam Daas&apos; sister commits suicide and then their father, Naarayan Daas (Bhaarat Bhushan) dies of shock. Dharam Daas vows to avenge for this tragedy in his family. Years later, Dharam Daas&apos; son, Kamal (Farooq Sheikh) and Deen Dayaal&apos;s daughter, Gulaab (Deepti Naval) happen to meet in college and fall in each other&apos;s love. When Dharam Daas comes to know of it, he perceives it as a means to settle his decades old score with Deen Dayaal. First he agrees for the marriage but later disapproves it and leaves no stone unturned in separating the lovers and hurting Deen Dayaal by all means. For this purpose, he goes hell bent upon ruining the life of Gulaab. Then, in return, Deen Dayaal also takes a similar path to harm Kamal. The lovers run away from their enemies who are actually their kins only. However while on the run, they ultimately realize that it&apos;s not possible for them to get united against the will of their mighty enemies. And they take one final decision about their lives.\n\nEk Baar Chale Aao scores mainly because of the touching performance of the lead pair. They made one of the most lovely on-screen pair of the early eighties and their amazing chemistry is available in Ek Baar Chale Aao also. They have risen above the script which is not great and created waves in the hearts of the viewers. Their love is appealing and real unlike the plastic and unreal love of the lead pair of Ishaqzaade. You laugh with them. You weep with them. After the movie is over, you leave the screen with a heavy heart, a throbbing pain deep within and that&apos;s the success of the narrator aptly supported by Farooq and Deepti. \n\nThe movie has been made in the style of a formula-based potboiler and the extra-ordinary impact that has come into existence is by default only. By default only, it has underscored the appalling consequences of the undesirable dowry custom. All things said and done, the movie is entertaining and the drama followed by romance followed by drama again maintains the interest of the viewer without a break. \n\nThough the climaxes of Kamal Hasan-Rati Agnihotri starrer classic movie - Ek Duje Ke Liye (1981) and Aamir Khan-Juhi Chawla starrer another classic movie - Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak (1988) are also more or less similar, Ishaqzaade is much closer to Ek Baar Chale Aao then the above-mentioned movies. The Hindu-Muslim or honour-killing angle is fictitious and illusionary in Ishaqzaade. Anybody who has seen Ek Baar Chale Aao can contrast the basic story idea as well as many scenes of Ishaqzaade with that. I am not saying that Ishaqzaade is a copy of Ek Baar Chale Aao. It&apos;s not a copy but Habib Faisal seems to have taken inspiration from Ek Baar Chale Aao for the story idea of Ishaqzaade and then through a proper adaptation he might have written an apparently different script. The lead characters of Ek Baar Chale Aao are real ones whom we can identify as from among us only and relate to them.\n\nThe music of this movie is good . Chaand Pardesi has composed tunes for the lyrics penned by Anjaan, his son - Sameer and Mohammad Iqbaal Khan. The best song is the title track which can be termed as an underrated song of Lata Mangeshkar. One song - Chirmi Babul Ki Laadli is a lift from an ages old Rajasthani folk song.\n\nI recommend this movie for entertainment as well as for watching an eye-opener against the dowry custom still existing in the Indian society and above all, for the performance of Farooq and Deepti who had their own fan-following during that period. This lovely pair appears as made for each other and if not for anything else, this movie is worth a watch for it."",""reviewRating""", , , ,"""2H17M""",39.0

We were backstabbed by China in 1962 and suffered a humiliating loss. However we inflicted crushing defeats on another enemy, Pakistan in 1965 and 1971. We did not initiate any of these wars on our own, we only defended our land when attacked by the concerned wicked neighbour. Indian population suffered a lot of hardships and Indian economy was hit hard on account of these wars but we kept our head high with pride. These developments on the borders led to the making of many patriotic movies in Bollywood. One of them is Phool Bane Angaare (1963) starring Maala Sinha, Raaj Kumar and debutante Aashish Kumar in principal roles.\n\nPhool Bane Angaare (flowers turned into cinders) starts with the love story of an army officer Captain Raajesh (Raaj Kumar) and a simple fatherless girl - Usha (Maala Sinha). Usha&apos;s father had passed away long back and she lives with her widow mother and a brother who is several years younger to her - Aashish (Sushil Kumar). She only runs the household by her earnings through tuition. Due to negative happenings in their neighbourhood and seeing his buddy suffering in the hands of the mother-in-law of his widow sister, Aashish becomes insecure and starts feeling that if his sister gets married, he would have to suffer the same way in her in-laws&apos; household after the death of his mother. Considering the feelings of her young brother who is very dear to her, Usha postpones the execution of her marriage plan. Meantime Raajesh is sent abroad by the army on a difficult mission from which he is not able to return for many years.\n\nDuring this period of Raajesh&apos;s absence, his widow mother (Mumtaaz Begum) lives alone getting older and sick on one hand, Usha fosters her younger brother Aashish (their mother passes away during this timespan) who has now grown-up into a youth (Aashish Kumar). Aashish falls into love with a rich but spoiled girl Kamla (Nasreen) and marries her against the wish of his motherlike elder sister, i.e., Usha who knows the defective personality of Kamla beforehand (because she used to take her tuition). Post this marriage, Kamla starts misbehaving with her unmarried sister-in-law, i.e., Usha and Aashish being a henpecked husband, only adds insult to the injury of his sacrificing elder sister. Usha leaves the parental home and destiny makes her the governess of Raajesh&apos;s ailing mother, thus bringing her to that house only which is supposed to be her Sasuraal (in-laws&apos; home). Raajesh&apos;s mother had never seen the girl whom her son had been in love with and wanted to marry but she is won over by the nature, behaviour and service of Usha. Raajesh comes back after many years only to find his sweetheart in his home only. His mother comes to know the reality of Usha and she arranges their marriage with utmost joy.\n\nOn the other side, Aashish who has always been a non-earning person, first sells the parental house under the influence of his wife and her brother (Mukri) but even then, there is no end to his humiliation in his own home. Finally, he leaves home and joins army. China attacks India and war breaks out. Not only the husband (Raajesh) and the brother (Aashish) of Usha involve in the war as the Indian soldiers but Usha also contributes to the nation&apos;s cause as a nurse. Raajesh is injured in the war but he comes home where Aashish happens to die due to injuries in front of his loving sister Usha only, repenting for his guilt done to his sister in his dying moments.\n\nThe problem of Phool Bane Angaare is that it&apos;s theme is not completely focused on patriotism. It starts as a romantic movie and thereafter remains a family drama for the major part of it. The issue of defending the frontiers of the motherland and the patriotism required for that comes in the final part of the movie only. However in the final reels, the significance of patriotism has been underscored very well which was the need of the hour then (and is today as well).\n\nKalyanji Anandji have composed good music for the movie using the beautiful lyrics of Anand Bakshi. Other than the patriotic song - Watan Pe Jo Fida Hoga (sung by Mohammad Rafi), the movie contains my favourite admiring song in the voice of Mukesh - Chaand Aahen Bharega, Phool Dil Thaam Lenge, Husn Ki Baat Chali To Sab Tera Naam Lenge. \n\nThe title of the movie is as such due to a line of the patriotic song - Watan Pe Jo Fida Hoga, Amar Woh Naujawan Hoga - Chaman Waalon Ki Gairat Ko Hai Sayyaadon Ne Lalkaara; Utho, Har Phool Se Keh Do Ki Ban Jaaye Woh Angaara; Nahin To Doston, Ruswa Hamaara Gulsitaan Hoga (The self-respect of the residents of the garden has been challenged by the fowlers; rise up and ask every flower to turn into a cinder; lest O friends, our garden should be defamed). Today, after half a century, the scenario is no different for India. Hence these lines are very relevant today also for our country and the countrymen."",""reviewRating""", , , ,"""2H13M""",59.0

Plus, you got a good performance from Sharat Saxena, who usually plays a straight out bad guy, but here he is ex-drug dealer informing the police about drug shipments. The death of his brother and son are the catalysts. That angle adds a bit of emotion and substance to the story. And enter Shakti Kapoor as Billa, an assassin hired by Madan Puri to kill Ajay, however, in some pretty terse scenes his murderous plans are scuppered by the charismatic disco dancer Mithun.

Then one day she met Karan, the Mitt..."",""","""How can you bring in more viewers into the theater with not so known star cast and very limited budgets? or How can you make your project famous without spending much on its promotional campaign? There are two simple answers to these questions. One, use a controversial burning topic to get yourself noticed and Two, incorporate many steamy, hot scenes into it which can get you more eyeballs at once. And looking at the track record of director Karan Razdan, he is well familiar with both these options and has used them in almost all his films till date. With a set strategy in mind, he comes up with yet another erotic kind of subject on the similar lines of his previous projects &quot;Hawas&quot;, &quot;Girlfriend&quot; and &quot;Souten&quot;. But the only difference is that in his latest venture, he has touched a more relevant, important and sensitive issue which may be new and a surprise eye-opener for many youngsters. &quot;Mittal Vs Mittal&quot; enlightens the viewer about the Indian Law against Domestic Violence in married couples and Marital Rape.\n\nSaid to be based on some true incidents, the movie revolves around a young girl, who falls in the love trap of a rich brat and then hurriedly gets married to him due to her family&apos;s pressure. But once she reaches the house of her loving husband, on the very first night she witnesses a completely different and ugly side of his character, which shatters all her dreams of a happy married life. And when the things become worse and cross their limits, she decides to leave the house and files a legal complaint against her husband in the court.\n\nThe screenplay is expectedly divided into two parts where before the intermission you are served with all those loving moments, songs and sensual scenes which are clearly directed in a way to bring in a specific section of viewers, especially targeted in the smaller centers. And the second half takes you into the court where the husband and his lawyer are ready to go on to any extreme and cheap levels to save their name and win the case. No doubt the subject is interesting but it&apos;s the execution which fails to move the movie to any greater heights above than a B grade kind of cinema.\n\nThough there are some remarkable scenes too which are surely well directed and well thought off by the writers. For instance, the scene where another victim girl tells her horrifying experiences of marital sex in front of a NGO panel (which may not be understood by many as its completely in English) and the sequence between the two male elders of both the families on the beach. But apart from these few scenes, there is a lot of confusion and filmy formula&apos;s added towards the end, which reduce the overall impact of the subject and its relevance.\n\nLike, throughout the court case it is not clear that whether they are discussing specifically Domestic Violence or Marital Rape. Even the judge&apos;s verdict in the end does not clearly mention any reason for his decision and he simply goes on to punish the husband. Moreover, the plot of husband&apos;s first marriage, the girl&apos;s mother not standing on her side and the mother-son dialogue suggesting her infidelity in the past was really absurd and un-necessary. Along with that, both the parties openly doing a T.V. chat show, when the case in still in the court was very childish thought of the director. The entire drama in the court was OK but it should have been more tense and engrossing as per the need of the subject.\n\nOn the performance front, Rituparna is very impressive in her portrayal of a victim girl and has a great screen presence. She rightly enacts the pain felt by the character with her own insight. Rohit is fine as the cunning husband but at times he looks like really acting with great effort. Gulshan Grover and Suchitra Krishnamurthy as the two lawyers in the court are impactful. Reema Lagoo, Amar Talwar and Dolly Thakore are OK but Anjan Shrivastava shines in the role of the girl&apos;s poet father. All songs in the narration are strictly average and the camera-work is also routine.\n\nTalking about the subject of Marital Rape, it really doesn&apos;t seem that the director was even interested in bringing some awareness in the society using this base. Because nowhere in the movie, he clearly informs the viewers (mainly female audiences) about any of their hidden rights or new changes in the Law which can help them to fight for their own dignity (Only taking names of certain sections do not serve the purpose). In fact the topic is only adopted to make a sensual movie which can also be discussed on the news channels on its release.\n\nIn simple words, this important subject has been dealt in a much better way in few other movies, which are a must see for any person, male or female, who at least is willing to think about the society we are living in.\n\nIf you are interested, I would like to recommend to watch &quot;Matrubhoomi&quot; at the earliest instead of this."",""reviewRating""","[""Drama""]","""2010-03-19""","{""total"":0", ,12.0

Shafi Inamdar plays a psychiatrist who makes wild statements and claims, his license should be revoked. Has absolutely no empathy with his patient, offers no cure and wants to keep straining himself.

The movie shows the clippings of Hitler and the world war II in the beginning and then declares that life is beautiful whereas death is horrifying and hence let&apos;s worship life and discard violence and killings irrespective of our objectives and missions undertaken.\n\nThe story presents Mr. Gupta(Ashok Kumar) as the most popular politician of the region(akin to Jawaahar Laal Nehru) who believes in reforming and replacing the existing system through peace and people&apos;s constructive cooperation for the benefit of the whole society. His one time associate, Mr. Jolkar(Moti Laal) has left him and his party and launched his own political outfit because of the ideological differences between the two. Mr. Jolkar(akin to the communist opponents of Jawaahar Laal Nehru in that period) believes in revolutionizing the system prevailing in the country by eliminating those who oppose any such change. He feels that violence is acceptable(and sometimes required) to meet the desired ends. He feels that Mr. Gupta is the biggest obstacle in his path of gaining political power and thereby bringing his desired system into reality and hence he decides to arrange his murder.\n\nA very intricate scheme is made by Mr. Jolkar and his associates to eliminate Mr. Gupta. A young and dedicated worker of Mr. Jolkar&apos;s party - Sanjay Malhotra(Joy Mukherjee) is assigned of first entering the household of Mr. Gupta, piercing his security and then kill him. However piercing the strong armour of security covering Mr. Gupta is not that easy. To ensure that, Sanjay uses the secretary of Mr. Gupta(Saira Baanu) who is already in love with a member of their party. She is made a pawn in this dangerous game because a look-alike of herself is already in the eyes of Sanjay and his companions. This look-alike is the princess of an erstwhile princely state whom Sanjay traps in his fake love and then schemes to substitute Mr. Gupta&apos;s secretary with her then ensure his entry to Mr. Gupta&apos;s residence through herself only.\n\nThough Sanjay is able to trap the princess in his fake love and make her dance to his tune and thereafter enter Mr. Gupta&apos;s house alongwith her by posing himself as her fiancé. However everything does not go according to his plan and not only he realizes the heinousness of the crime he&apos;s about to perpetrate but also first, he has to run for his life and then he finds himself trapped in the charge of the murder of another worker(a female) of Mr. Jolkar&apos;s party. The climax contains a highly emotional tone with Mr. Jolkar&apos;s realization of his treading the wrong path.\n\nPious intentions do not necessarily lead to pious results in case the correct things necessary to execute them are not done. Exactly this has happened with Yeh Zindagi Kitni Haseen Hai. I do not know the origin of the theme as to whether it&apos;s the own idea of the script-writer or lifted from somewhere. However the end result of his work is disastrous. A major chunk of the narrative has been devoted to Sanjay&apos;s implementing his scheme of trapping the princess in his fake love and then fill this wrong fact in her psyche that she is not any princess but the secretary of Mr. Gupta. It&apos;s this part of the story which lets the complete movie down, making a mockery of the great theme picked for making this movie.\n\nThe scenes which are directly linked to the theme of futility and undesirableness of violence are the most impressive ones. The scene of the sacrifice of the lead actress in one of her roles is able to move the audience deep within. How the committed party workers are brainwashed to be ready to sacrifice their own lives alongwith those of their near and dear ones for the so-called great cause has been shown effectively.\n\nDirector R.K. Nayyar could not draw praiseworthy performances from the lead pair. Despite being in double role, Saira Baanu could not do much except looking beautiful(she was called Beauty Queen in her heyday). Joy Mukherjee is over the top for most of time especially when he is trying to brainwash the lady for his vested interest(in fact, the vested interest of his party). It&apos;s the seasoned actors of Bollywood - Ashok Kumar and Moti Laal who have delivered towering performances and thereby succeeded at least partially in hiding the deficiencies of the script. The supporting cast has done well.\n\nYeh Zindagi Kitni Haseen Hai is an opportunity wasted. However courtesy some impressive sequences, some great performances, some good songs, beautiful locations and above all, the great theme; I recommend this movie as a decent one time watch to those who are fond of watching golden oldies."",""reviewRating""", , , ,"""2H39M""",56.0
